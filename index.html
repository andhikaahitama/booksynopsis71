Now Jemmie, following Skye as she seeks out her granddaughter to share some sad news, is cleverly reunited with Jasmine, whom he's determined to make his bride.

When she rejects his suit, he vows vengeance. It takes all of Jasmine's courage and Skye's still formidable talents to vanquish this threat to happiness.

As Christian parents, we want to nurture a hearty faith in our children; as children raised in religious homes, we often contend with our parents in an effort to embrace a faith that is somehow "our own." <p>In Growing Pains, Randall Balmer addresses these issues. His book is an honest yet tender record of a man's spiritual "coming of age" in the shadow of a strong, fundamentalist father. His engaging stories include everything from baseball to John Lennon to tidbits of Christian history. Ultimately, Balmer tells how he discovered the unconditional love of a heavenly father through grace, seeking, and identification with Jesus the son. </p><p>"A moving, inspiring, and extraordinary book. Randall Balmer sees the power of the gospel story, tells his own story of faith and, in so doing, invites the reader to do the same. His honesty is humbling, his vision challenging. I commend Growing Pains to everyone on the journey to a meaningful faith grounded in the love and grace of God." -Jim Wallis, Sojourners magazine; author, Faith Works </p><p>"Reading this book touched me in the deep places. Randy Balmer's reflection on key events in his own life is evangelical 'testifying' at its best. He talks honestly about his failures and hurts, but in a way that leaves us with a more profound awareness of the grace that is greater than all our sin." -Richard J. Mouw, Fuller Theological Seminary</p>"On my desk in New York sits a photograph of a seven-year-old boy. He's wearing a pair of glasses, a freshly ironed shirt buttoned to the neck, and his best smile. I placed that picture on my desk at the suggestion of a friend who understood that, as someone who grew up fundamentalist, I was having a difficult time finding my way as an adult. Just look at that picture of yourself as a child, he suggested, and try to recall what it was like to be that child." <p>"I can now see beyond the spectacles and into his eyes. I see his innocence and his vulnerability. I see how desperately he wants to be loved. I see how hard he tries to win the approval of those around him. I see him in Sunday school singing, 'Jesus loves me, this I know / for the Bible tells me so.' And I know that seven-year-old boy has no idea as he belts out the melody at the top of his lungs how much he will come to rely on the profound truth of those simple words three decades later."</p></p><h2>Questions and Answers on the Science of Mind</h2><p><b>More than 300 solutions to real-life situations from the creator of the Science of Mind philosophy. </b><p>Ernest Holmes's Science of Mind philosophy has reached millions of students, through his books and the hundreds of spiritual centers across the United States and Canada.

She was having a party and Jamie was mad because she hadn&#x2019;t invited him. When they were in high school together, she was always nice to him even though he was in special classes. But Mom had told him that it was probably just a party only for Kerry&#x2019;s classmates who would be leaving for college next week. Jamie had graduated from high school two years ago and now had a good job stocking shelves in the local Acme supermarket.<br> <br>Jamie didn&#x2019;t tell Mom that if the kids at the party started swimming in Kerry&#x2019;s pool, he was going to go over and swim with them. He knew Mom would be mad at him if he did that. But Kerry always invited him to swim in her pool when she was swimming. He watched from the window of his room until all the kids went home and Kerry was alone outside on the patio cleaning up.<br> <br>He watched the end of his video. He decided to go over and help her, even though he knew Mom would not want him to.<br> <br>He slipped downstairs, where Mom was watching the eleven o&#x2019;clock news, and tiptoed behind the hedges that separated his small backyard from Kerry&#x2019;s big one.<br> <br>But then he saw someone come into the yard from the woods. He grabbed something off a chair and came up behind Kerry, hit her on the head, and pushed her into the pool. Then he threw something away.<br> <br>You&#x2019;re not supposed to hit people or push them in pools, Jamie thought. The man should say he&#x2019;s sorry, or he might get a time-out. Kerry&#x2019;s swimming, so I can go swimming with her, he told himself.<br> <br>The man didn&#x2019;t go swimming. He ran away from the yard and back into the woods. He didn&#x2019;t go in the house. He just ran away.<br> <br>Jamie hurried toward the pool. His foot kicked something that was on the ground. It was a golf club. He picked it up, carried it toward the pool and put it on one of the chairs.<br> <br>He said, &#x201c;Kerry, it&#x2019;s Jamie. I&#x2019;ll go swimming with you now.&#x201d;<br> <br>But she didn&#x2019;t answer him. He started to walk down the pool steps. The water looked dirty. He thought maybe somebody spilled something. But when he felt the water in his new sneakers, soaking his pants up to his knees, he stopped. Even though Kerry always said he could swim with her, he knew that Mom would be mad if he got his new sneakers wet. Kerry was floating in the water. He reached out, touched her shoulder and said, &#x201c;Kerry, wake up.&#x201d; But Kerry just floated farther away, to the deep end of the pool. So he went back home.<br> <br>The news was still on the television, so Mom didn&#x2019;t see him when he sneaked back upstairs and went to bed. He knew his sneakers, socks and pants were wet, so he hid them on the floor of his closet. Maybe they&#x2019;ll dry before Mom finds them, he hoped.<br> <br>As he was falling asleep, he wondered if Kerry was having fun swimming.</p><h2>A Pound of Flesh: Perilous Tales of How to Produce Movies in Hollywood</h2><p>The author, a Hollywood producer, describes how movies are made, sharing his experiences working with Robert De Niro, Brian De Palma, Sean Penn, and Sean Connery</p><p>Art Linson, producer of such Hollywood films as <i>Car Wash</i>, <i>The Untouchables</i>, <i>Melvin &amp; Howard</i>, and <i>This Boy's Life</i>, among others, has written a chummy and chatty how-to "for that small and perhaps unfortunate group"--aspiring movie producers. Seduced by the glitz, glamour, and cutthroat glee that clung (and clings) to Hollywood producers, young Linson never really "got" what it was they did. In 1961, when he was getting started, a producer's role was as ill-defined as it was just this side of unseemly. Producers, begins Linson in the highly amusing, anecdotal <i>A Pound of Flesh</i>, were "compared to Willy Loman, not Arthur Miller." <p> Make no mistake: Linson is lecturing to the Hollywood aspirant--not to aspiring auteurs or scrappy independent filmmakers. As such, <i>A Pound of Flesh</i> is a strange breed--more travelogue through Tinseltown than down-to-earth how-to. It's ripe with gossip and "aren't we wonderful?" scenes--the morphing of Hunter S. Thompson's <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i> into an updated, drug-drenched version of <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>. Walking into Thompson's hotel room for the initial meeting, Linson was confronted with a smoking gun and a four-inch hole in the wall. And that's just the beginning of their "negotiations." (The film actually became <i>Where the Buffalo Roam</i>, starring Bill Murray.) </p><p> Where the chatty, chummy Linson primer becomes useful is with behind-the-scenes examples of such "lessons" as pitching the idea; working with writers, directors, and cast members; and understanding budgets and the studio system. Where it goes soft is with such vague and hip promptings as "if you have a head filled with good ideas, an extended list of Hollywood hangouts is more beneficial than a list of agencies and production companies." So introverts beware! To succeed in Hollywood, you still need the chutzpah, the connections, and the dough. </p><p> Wild exploits, turns of fate, and serendipities characterize the brazen and breezy teachings of <i>A Pound of Flesh</i>. What is fabulous is Linson's unbridled enthusiasm. Aspirants and movie fans alike will find this highly entertaining book a quick read, hard to put down, and irresistible. But rely on Linson as your sole Virgil through Tinseltown and your dreams of artistic success will surely falter.</p>Have you ever wondered what a Hollywood movie producer actually does? In A Pound of Flesh, producer Art Linson takes us behind closed doors on a rare backstage tour through Hollywood. With amusing stories that recount his challenging experiences with a legion of players whose roster includes David Mamet, Robert De Niro, Jeff Katzenberg, Brian De Palma, Sean Penn, Ned Tanen, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, and Sean Connery, Unson sheds klieg lights on the mystery behind the moviemaking process. From acquiring scripts to hiring a writer, packaging the talent, and facing the horror of opening night, you&#39;ll glimpse the sweat on the brows of some of Tinseltown&#39;s hottest players as they sidestep minefields at the box office, grin through embarrassing defeats, and occasionally bow to the magic of success. A Pound of Flesh is the first guide by a true insider to exactly how movies get made in Hollywood. Linson maps the entire course, beginning with that initial spark of an idea that propels the producer into action, through unpredictable and often chaotic meetings with writers, agents, and movie executives, and even on to the fearsome task of confronting preview audiences and the critics. He chronicles his own disasters and successes, charting the bloody process by which a film is finally, and at times painfully, realized on the screen. We are brought into executive suites, made privy to cellular phone conversations, and escorted onto the sets of multimillion-dollar productions to see what it takes to get a movie made, as well as to learn why other projects, despite the vast effort and money behind them, can ultimately end up gathering dust on some studio&#39;s forgotten shelf, or in pieces on the cuttingroom floor. A Pound of Flesh is an engaging, informative, and oftentimes hilarious account of one man&#39;s odyssey to compete in America&#39;s cruelest, most glamorous industry. This is a book for film students, movie lovers, and anyone interested in the backstage drama of Hollywood.</p><h2>My First Time, Vol. 2: Gay Men Describe Their First Same-Sex Experience</h2><p>An all new collection of sexy , ture &#34;first-time&#34;stories by gay men from around the world - the sequel to the national-besteller My First Time!</p><p>Jack Hart&#39;s first book was the best-selling Gay Sex: A Manual for Men Who Love Men.

This is home, my little one. This is where we live."<br><br>As Mother sews a quilt for Baby, she quietly tells its story, patchwork square by square. There are the frolicking sheep and lambs, and there&#x2019;s the collie, Floss, who helps Daddy herd them. There are the mare and her frisky foal, a flapping goose and her gosling, a cat curled up with her kitten. And when the story is done, there is a soft quilt to surround Baby with all the scenes of a family&#x2019;s familiar world.</p><p>Kim Lewis, the author-illustrator of FLOSS, JUST LIKE FLOSS, LITTLE BAA, and other picture books about farm life, lives on a sheep farm in England. Of A QUILT FOR BABY, she says, &#34;From an early age, I remember my mother quilting. It seemed natural to use the idea of the quilt as an heirloom for passing on my hopes and feelings about farming.&#34;PreS-Gr. 1. As a mother sews, she talks to her baby about the quilt she is making. Stitched into the squares are pictures representing their farm, including many baby animals: puppy, lamb, calf, foal, chick, gosling, kid, and kitten. After she finishes the quilt, the mother wraps her baby in it and quietly recapitulates the pictures appliqued onto it. The baby falls asleep. The rhythmic text flows along in a soothing way, making this a good, soporific story for bedtime. A typical spread in this large-format picture book features a big picture showing a scene in the house or around the farm and, on the opposite page, a smaller picture of a quilt square representing the same subject. Children will enjoy seeing the larger, more realistic drawings alongside the simplified representations of the same scenes. Color-coordinated with the quilt-square backgrounds, page borders in gingham prints set off the precise, delicately colored pencil drawings to perfection. Fans of Lewis' other picture books will recognize Floss the collie among the animals on the farm. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This book presents new findings that radically change our existing views of humanity&#39;s global migration. Its main argument centers around the theory that there was only one exodus, one group of early modern humans from Africa, that went on to people the rest of the world. It suggests that this exodus took place 80,000 years ago via a little known southern route across the mouth of the Red Sea. It also argues that living Malaysian tribes provide an extant link of the route pursued from there, as modern humans beachcombed their way to Australia in the space of 10,000 years. These theories form an account of modern man&#39;s remaining journey around the world - to the Mammoth Steppe heartland of Asia, to the now submerged continent of Beringia, and on to the last great unpeopled lands of the Americas. Drawing on genetics, archaeology, palaeontology and climatology, this book represents a new understanding of prehistory.</p><p>Stephen Oppenheimer of University of Oxford is a leading expert in the use of DNA to track migrations.

Carefully distinguishing indefensible forms of fideism that involve a rejection of reason from responsible forms of fideism that require reason to become self-critical, C. Stephen Evans unfolds a Kierkegaardian view that genuine religious knowledge is grounded in faith beyond reason. / Three versions of responsible fideism are discussed and analyzed. First, Evans looks at faith without reasons, illustrating this form of attack on evidentialism with the thought of Alvin Plantinga and William James. Next, Evans considers the form of fideism that understands faith as above reason, a view exemplified by Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant. Finally, Evans examines the form of fideism that claims that faith must go against what is taken as rational by most human societies. This position is most clearly displayed in the writings of Kierkegaard. Evans here defends the Kierkegaardian view that genuine religious knowledge is grounded in faith beyond reason by analyzing faith as making possible a critical analysis of the limits of reason that reason itself can recognize as sound. Evans&#x2019;s discussion is deepened by concrete examples of how fideists might view three traditional topics in philosophy of religion: the knowledge of God&#x2019;s existence, the problem of evil, and the verifiability of divine revelation.</p><p>Distinguished Professor of Philosophy and Humanities at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.

A senior executive at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford is found in his office with a bullet hole between his eyes, a pistol discarded close by. The death has officially been ruled as suicide by local police, but with an apparent lack of motive for such action, the museum&#x2019;s administrator, Gladstone Marriott, suspects foul play. With his cast-iron reputation for shrewdness, formed during his time investigating the case of Jack the Ripper alongside Inspector Abberline, private enquiry agent Daniel Wilson is a natural choice to discreetly explore the situation, ably assisted by his partner, archaeologist-cum-detective Abigail Fenton. Yet their enquiries are hindered from the start by an interfering lone agent from Special Branch, ever secretive and intimidating in his methods. With rumours of political ructions from South Africa, mislaid artefacts and a lost Shakespeare play, Wilson and Fenton soon find themselves tangled in bureaucracy. Making unlikely alliances, the pair face players who live by a different set of rules and will need their intellect and ingenuity to reveal the secrets of the aristocracy.</p><p>Jim Eldridge has had over one hundred books published, which have sold over three million copies.

Originally published in 1938 by the Bobbs-Merrill Company. <br> <br> The Reconstruction is one of the most complex and fascinating chapters in American history. Initially driven by a just repugnance to the institution of slavery, it promised a new era of human rights and a new dispensation for the dispossessed. But it soon became tainted by corruption, vindictiveness and greed, and ultimately failed in its nobler aims. The author undertakes to put together in one continuous thread of story, the key events of the period in each of the southern states. <br> <br> Includes black-and-white illustrations and Index.</p><p></p><h2>Hard Green: Saving The Environment From The Environmentalists: A Conservative Manifesto</h2><p>This book sets out the case for Hard Green, a conservative environmental agenda. Modern environmentalism, Peter Huber argues, destroys the environment. Captured as it has been by the Soft Green oligarchy of scientists, regulators, and lawyers, modern environmentalism does not conserve forests, oceans, lakes, and streams - it hastens their destruction. For all its scientific pretension, Soft Green is not green at all. Its effects are the opposites of green.This book lays out the alternative: a return to Yellowstone and the National Forests, the original environmentalism of Theodore Roosevelt and the conservation movement. Chapter by chapter, <i>Hard Green</i> takes on the big issues of environmental discourse from scarcity and pollution to efficiency and waste disposal. This is the Hard Green manifesto: Rediscover T.R. Reaffirm the conservationist ethic. Expose the Soft Green fallacy. Reverse the Soft Green agenda. Save the environment from the environmentalists.</p><p><i>Hard Green</i>, by conservative engineer-attorney Peter Huber, pulls off a neat trick: redefining the terms of discussion to win by default. Environmentalists will be surprised to learn that <i>green</i> rightfully refers <i>only</i> to conservation of wilderness lands--certainly a noble cause, and just about the only green issue likely to fire up traditional conservatives. Well worth reading by those of all political perspectives, Huber's writing is as clear and thorough as you'd expect from someone with his training. His assertions that shortages of fuel, food, and space for waste will be solved by ingenuity seem dazzlingly hopeful, but ultimately his arguments come down to faith. Much stronger are his discussions of privatizing pollution and wilderness protection, which should open eyes across the board. Moreover, his analysis of recycling programs and their ilk gives a much-needed kick in the pants to complacent types who think their garbage sorting is helping anything but their consciences. While it's unlikely to change the political Green movement, much less supplant it, <i>Hard Green</i> will certainly encourage thinking among the thoughtful--and that might be all we need. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>Peter Huber is a Senior Fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Using archaeological evidence to supplement written sources, the author traces the growth of the kingdoms of the Goths, Franks and Saxons, culminating in the age of Charlemagne, and shows how this early renaissance in Europe was broken down by the fresh barbarian movements of the Vikings. Four visual stories treat the legend of Arthur and the Britons, settlements and house building, the victory of the church, and the royal palaces.</p><p></p><h2>Nine Medieval Romances of Magic: Re-Rhymed in Modern English</h2><p><p> In this book, Marijane Osborn translates into modern English nine lively medieval verse romances, in a form that both reflects the original and makes the romances inviting to a modern audience. All nine tales contain elements of magic: shapeshifters, powerful fairies, trees that are portals to another world, and enchanted clothing and armor. Many of the tales also feature powerful women characters, while others include representations of &#x201c;Saracens.&#x201d; The tales address issues of enduring interest and concern, and also address sexuality, agency, and identity formation in unexpected ways. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Marijane Osborn </strong> is Professor Emeritus of English at the University of California, Davis. A poet, she is also a widely published scholar and translator of Old and Middle English literature. </p><p> &#x201c;The fairy legends of medieval Britain are at the very heart of romance: lightly touched, shimmering with suggestion, as hard to catch in their rhythmic dance as the elves glimpsed at twilight. They deal with otherworld lovers, enchanted hags, magic trees and magic animals, strange abductions and bold rescues. Yet they have never been well-known except to scholars, for the Middle English and Scots in which they are written is difficult enough to keep readers at bay, and in prose translation they lose much of their charm. Marijane Osborn&#x2019;s rendition of nine of the best of them into modern English verse saves the situation, and opens the poems up to the wider audience they deserve. Her poetry pulses with life, like the originals, and her introductions to each poem set the originals in context with impeccable scholarship.&#x201d; &#x2015; Thomas Shippey, Professor Emeritus, Saint Louis University </p> <p> &#x201c;With characteristic erudition, wit, and grace, Professor Osborn both contextualizes and makes accessible one familiar and eight previously remote and seldom-read medieval romances. Even Chaucer&#x2019;s Herry Bailey will find no &#x2018;drasty rymyng&#x2019; here. Instead, readers will be pleased to make the acquaintance of John Gower and Thomas Chestre as well as the five anonymous authors presented so well in these pages.&#x201d; &#x2015; Robert E.

He is also the director of The Writing Program at Sundance Institute.This recording of poetry is accompanied by a text that includes the contributors' biographies and comments. The project, an anthology of favorite poems from actors and directors, is well intentioned but uneven. The text is a richer compilation of poems, as the recording contains barely a handful of poems--the text includes 80 poems, the recording only 15. While the text contains poems selected by actors noted for their interesting and trained voices, such as Kyra Sedgwick and Jane Fonda, their voices are not on the CD. Further, the readers who are on the recording do not do justice to the poems they selected.

Dahl seems to know just how far to go with his oddball fantasies; in <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,</i> for example, nasty Violet Beauregarde blows up into a blueberry from sneaking forbidden chewing gum, and bratty Augustus Gloop is carried away on the river of chocolate he wouldn't resist. In fact, all manner of disasters can happen to the most obnoxiously deserving of children because Dahl portrays each incident with such resourcefulness and humor. <p> <i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</i> is a singular delight, crammed with mad fantasy, childhood justice and revenge, and as much candy as you can eat.

How should we understand such concepts as: the beloved, physical beauty, the beauty that transcends the physical, and the power of love between men as the ancient Greeks understood it? In these three dialogues, the Lysis, Phaedrus, and Symposium, Socrates, the gadfly of Athens, searches for the truth about love and friendship. In doing so, he reveals how his Athenian contemporaries regarded homosexual love as an educative, aesthetic, and social force.</p><p><b>PLATO</b>&nbsp;was born about 427 B.C.E. into the distinguished Athenian family of Ariston and Perictione. Although interested in politics as a young man, he became disenchanted with the cruel and immoral behavior of Athenian rulers. Some small ray of hope emerged when Athens deposed its dictators and established a democracy; however, when the citizens put the philosopher Socrates on trial and later executed him for impiety, Plato left Athens to travel abroad.<br><br>In 387 B.C.E., Plato finally returned to Athens and created the Academy, an intellectual center for philosophy and science that offered scholarly training in such fields as astronomy, biological sciences, mathematics, and political science. From this influen�tial institution emerged Aristotle, Plato's most famous student. Plato dedicated himself to the Academy until his death in about 347 B.C.E.<br><br>During his lifetime Plato wrote a number of supremely important dialogues, which presented and critically analyzed significant philosophical ideas in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and social and political philosophy&#x2014;all of which con�tinue to engage posterity.

Unlike this vast archive, produced primarily by male photographers, which depicted American Indians as either vanishing or domesticated, the lesser-known images by the women featured in&nbsp;<i>Trading Gazes</i>&nbsp;provide new ways of seeing the intersecting histories of colonial expansion and indigenous resistance. Four unconventional women-Jane Gay, who documented land allotment to the Nez Perces; Kate Cory, an artist who lived for years in a Hopi community; Grace Nicholson, who purchased cultural items from the Karuk and other northern California tribes; and Mary Schaffer, who traveled among the Stoney and M�tis of Alberta, Canada-used cameras to document their cross-cultural encounters.</p><p><i>Trading Gazes</i>&nbsp;reconstructs the rich biographical and historical contexts explaining these women's presence in different Native communities of the North American West.

By tracing the complex, often unexpected relationships forged between these women, their cameras, and the Native subjects of their photographs,&nbsp;<i>Trading Gazes</i>&nbsp;offers a new focus for recovering women's histories in the West while bringing attention to the complicated legacies of these images for Native and non-Native viewers.</p><p></p></p><p><b>Susan Bernardin</b>&nbsp;is an assistant professor of Native American and American Literature at SUNY-Oneonta.&nbsp;<b>Melody Graulich</b>&nbsp;is a professor of English/American studies at Utah State University and the editor of&nbsp;<i>Western American Literature.</i>&nbsp;<b>Lisa MacFarlane</b>&nbsp;is an associate professor of English and coordinator of American studies at the University of New Hampshire.&nbsp;<b>Nicole Tonkovich</b>&nbsp;is an associate professor of literature at the University of California, San Diego.Rich, exciting, and important insights emerge from this collaborative venture -- <i>Priscilla Wald, author of Constituting Americans: Cultural Anxiety and Narrative Form</i></p><h2>The Syrian Rebellion</h2><p>Fouad Ajami offers a detailed historical perspective on the current rebellion in Syria. Focusing on the similarities and differences in skills between former dictator Hafez al-Assad and his successor son, Bashar, Ajami explains how an irresistible force clashed with an immovable object: the regime versus people who conquered fear to challenge a despot of unspeakable cruelty.</p><p><p>When the Arab Spring exploded across the Middle East, it was no surprise that the eruption in Syria came after the upheavals in Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Bahrain. The Syrians had taken their time, knowing that they were in for a particularly grim and bloody struggle. But four decades of a brutal dictatorship under the Assad dynasty could not crush their spirit-people were done with the Assad tyranny and ready to pay the ultimate price. The dictatorship alternated savage violence with promises of reform, but the barrier of fear had been broken; its horrific deeds only strengthened the resolve of those who wanted done with that cruel regime.</p><p>In <i>The Syrian Rebellion</i>, Fouad Ajami offers a detailed historical perspective on the current rebellion in Syria. Focusing on the similarities and differences in skills between former dictator Hafez al-Assad and his successor son, Bashar, he tells how Syria has overcome decades of repression, numerous coups, and other hardships to arrive at its current state of affairs: a people poised to throw off the yoke of oppression and move forward.</p><p>In 1994 Hafez Assad's oldest son, Bassel, whom he had been grooming for succession, was killed in a car accident. Hafez then settled on his other son Bashar, an eye doctor, as his successor. Syrians hoped for the best, thinking that perhaps this gangly youth, with a stint in London behind him, would grant them the freedoms denied by his father. They were wrong. When the political hurricane known as the Arab Spring hit the region, Bashar al-Assad proclaimed his country's immunity to the troubles. He was wrong. As Ajami explains, Bashar, the accidental inheritor of his father's political realm, now had his own war. He had stepped out of his father's shadow only to merge with it. But the house that Hafez Assad built, some four decades ago, is not destined to last.</p><p><b>LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON? THE LOST BEQUEST OF HAFEZ ASSAD</b></p><p>Arabs are firm believers in <i>nasab</i>, inherited merit passed on from father to son, a nobility of the blood. So what mattered when a rebellion broke out in Syria in 2011 was the insight into the similarities and the differences between Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar. The father had rigged the succession, with fear completing the trick. Although the people fervently hoped that Bashar would open up the prison that Syria had become under his father, it was not to be.</p><p>In <i>The Syrian Rebellion</i>, Middle East expert Fouad Ajami explains how an irresistible force clashed with an immovable object: the regime versus a people who conquered fear to challenge a despot of unspeakable cruelty. Offering a detailed historical perspective, he shows how, for four long decades, the Assad dynasty, the intelligence barons, and the brigade commanders had grown accustomed to a culture of quiescence and silence. But Syrians did not want to be ruled by Bashar's children the way they had been ruled by Bashar and their parents had been by Bashar's father. This book tells how a proud people came to demand something more than a despotic regime of dictatorship and plunder.</p><p><b>Fouad Ajami</b> is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the co-chair of the Herbert and Jane Dwight Working Group on Islamism and the International Order.</p></p><h2>Tell Them We Are Singing for Jesus: The Original Fisk Jubilee Singers and Christian Reconstruction, 1871-1878</h2><p>Between 1871 and 1878, the Jubilee Singers presented concerts featuring the Negro spiritual that won the applause and admiration of the Western world.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Survival: How to Prevail in Hostile Environments</h2><p>Survival provides clear, authoritative answers to these and hundreds of other questions as well as solid information on how to survive in almost every outdoor situation imaginable: the jungle, the desert, the sea, the mountains, the poles.

In addition to the usual-and some unusual-survival guidelines, which incorporate the latest discoveries about the body's reaction to extreme conditions, it offers true stories of survival as well as numerous "sight bites" that both inform and entertain. The book is divided into three main sections: major threats (cold, thirst, snakes, etc.); hostile environments (e.g., desert, jungle, mountains); and how science can aid in survival (food gathering, preparing for weather conditions). The author's explanations of physiological responses are useful. Both exhaustive and eminently readable, this title is also useful for biology and earth science project ideas.<br><i>Judy McAloon, Potomac Library, Prince William County, VA</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Into the Hands of the Soldiers: Freedom and Chaos in Egypt and the Middle East</h2><p><b>ONE OF <i>THE ECONOMIST'S</i> BOOKS OF THE YEAR<br><br>A candid narrative of how and why the Arab Spring sparked, then failed, and the truth about America's role in that failure and the subsequent military coup that put Sisi in power--from the Middle East correspondent of the <i>New York Times</i>.</b><br><br>In 2011, Egyptians of all sects, ages, and social classes shook off millennia of autocracy, then elected a Muslim Brother as president. The 2013 military coup replaced him with a new strongman, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has cracked down on any dissent or opposition with a degree of ferocity Mubarak never dared. <i>New York Times</i> correspondent David D. Kirkpatrick arrived in Egypt with his family less than six months before the uprising first broke out in 2011, looking for a change from life in Washington, D.C. As revolution and violence engulfed the country, he received an unexpected and immersive education in the Arab world.<br><br>For centuries, Egypt has set in motion every major trend in politics and culture across the Middle East, from independence and Arab nationalism to Islamic modernism, political Islam, and the jihadist thought that led to Al Qaeda and ISIS. The Arab Spring revolts of 2011 spread from Cairo, and now Americans understandably look with cynical exasperation at the disastrous Egyptian experiment with democracy. They fail to understand the dynamic of the uprising, the hidden story of its failure, and Washington's part in that tragedy. In this candid narrative, Kirkpatrick lives through Cairo's hopeful days and crushing disappointments alongside the diverse population of his new city: the liberal yuppies who first gathered in Tahrir Square; the persecuted Coptic Christians standing guard around Muslims at prayer during the protests; and the women of a grassroots feminism movement that tried to seize its moment. Juxtaposing his on-the-ground experience in Cairo with new reporting on the conflicts within the Obama administration, Kirkpatrick traces how authoritarianism was allowed to reclaim Egypt after thirty months of turmoil.<br><br><i>Into the Hands of the Soldiers</i> is a heartbreaking story with a simple message: The failings of decades of autocracy are the reason for the chaos we see today across the Arab world. Because autocracy is the problem, more autocracy is unlikely to provide a durable solution. Egypt, home to one in four Arabs, is always a bellwether. Understanding its recent history is essential to understanding everything taking place across the region today--from the terrorist attacks in the North Sinai and Egypt's new partnership with Israel to the bedlam in Syria and Libya.</p><p>David D. Kirkpatrick is a prize-winning international <i>New York Times</i> correspondent based in London. From 2011 through 2015 he was the Cairo bureau chief. He has also been a reporter for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and a contributing editor for <i>New York</i> magazine. This is his first book.<p>1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whoever Drinks the Water</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Driving east from Tunis may be the best way to take in the miracle of the Nile. The road follows the Mediterranean coast for about seventeen hundred miles. Almost every inch of it is brown twelve months a year-rock and sand baking in the sun. Then you cross an invisible line at the edge of the Nile Valley. Everywhere is an eruption of green. Not even the congestion of Cairo can contain the riot of vegetation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For millennia, no other territory in the Middle East produced such a bounty. Where the yearly flooding of the Euphrates was violent and destructive, the cycles of the Nile were gentle and predictable. A truism holds that the histories of Egypt and Iraq follow their rivers. Medieval sultans dug a well, known today as the Nile-o-meter, on Rawda Island in Cairo, to measure the water level. The annual rise determined how generous the crops would be that year, and the sultans taxed the peasants accordingly. Farming was that easy. The Nile Valley became the breadbasket of the Arab world. Egyptians swelled with pride in their river. Whoever drinks the water of the Nile will return again to Egypt, the old saying goes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Egyptians also like to say that they have been rallying around grand national projects since the Pharaohs built the temples of Thebes. After taking power in 1952, President Gamal Abdel Nasser decided to build a great dam at Aswan, near the Sudanese border, to harness the Nile for hydroelectric power. Abdel Nasser promised a dam "more magnificent and seventeen times greater than the Pyramids."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secretary of State John Foster Dulles announced in 1955 that the United States and the United Kingdom would provide $70 million in assistance for construction of the dam. But he did not like Abdel Nasser's denunciations of colonialism, or his refusal to ally exclusively with Washington. After seven months, Dulles withdrew the offer. Abdel Nasser turned to Moscow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dam became a monument to Stalinist engineering. Its construction displaced one hundred twenty thousand Nubians, the dark-skinned Egyptians indigenous to the area. The lake formed by the dam nearly demolished the breathtaking Pharaonic temples at Abu Simbel; UNESCO saved them by paying Western European contractors to relocate the complex, stone by stone, on drier ground. The finished dam stopped the flow of silt and nutrients that had kept much of the Nile Valley so fertile for centuries. The depletion of the water devastated the farmlands downstream and the fishing around the mouth of the Nile. The slowing of the current led to an explosion in waterborne diseases like schistosomiasis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To fight the disease, Abdel Nasser's successors launched a massive campaign of inoculations. But government health workers reused unsterilized needles. That set off a hepatitis C epidemic that raged on for decades. About one in five Egyptians was infected with "virus C," as Egyptians called it, in imported English. Barbers spread the disease by reusing blades, so sensible Egyptian men carried their own personal shears to haircuts, and I did as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The adage about drinking the Nile water lives on today as black humor. The river is so filthy that your first stop would be a hospital. Yet Egyptian schoolchildren are still taught to celebrate Abdel Nasser's High Dam as an unalloyed triumph. I think of the dam whenever I get a haircut: a parable of centralized planning and unaccountable power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had the luck to be an American journalist living in Cairo during the thirty months when Egyptians broke free of the autocracy that ruled them. Their escape set off revolts from Benghazi to Baghdad. But the old authoritarian order had only hidden underground, not shattered. It returned to take revenge. A reinvigorated autocracy did its best to blot out the memory of those thirty months of freedom. Let me tell you the story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>City of Contradictions</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>August 14, 2010-January 1, 2011</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My introduction to Egypt was an iftar-the ritual meal at dusk to break the Ramadan fast-on a gritty day in August 2010.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My family and I had moved that week into a one-story villa in Maadi, a leafy district about six miles up the Nile from the New York Times bureau on the island of Zamalek. Both neighborhoods-Maadi and Zamalek-are full of Western expats and Egyptian old money. I had a twenty-minute drive to work if the streets were empty. Usually the lawless traffic made the trip more than an hour. Mercedes sedans and Land Rovers veered around donkey carts stacked with carrots or garlic. Families of four or five crammed onto the backs of Korean motorcycles, and mothers rode sidesaddle with infants in their arms. My wife, Laura, and I had hauled our one-year-old's car seat all the way from Washington. We felt so fussy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was drawn to Egypt in part by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. I knew the roots of Al Qaeda and its ideology ran back to Egypt. Also, I had turned forty in 2010. I wanted a change from Washington, where I had reported for the previous six years. That was about the extent of my preparation for my posting in Cairo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was thrilled with the job. Egypt, home to a quarter of all Arabs, had set every major trend in religion, culture, and politics across the Arab world for more than half a century. Egypt commanded the largest Arab army and held together the region. It kept the peace with Israel. After Israel, Cairo had received more United States aid over the decades than any other country-over $70 billion, at a rate of $1.5 billion a year at the time I arrived. Whatever happened in Egypt was in a way an American story.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The skinny apparatchik in charge of the international news media had welcomed me to Egypt just a few days earlier. He told me that the Foreign Ministry had recalled him from the San Francisco consulate to apply his public relations expertise to the upcoming reelection of President Hosni Mubarak, who was then eighty-two and seeking his seventh five-year term in office. But the genial bureaucrat, Attiya Shakran, talked mostly about how sorry he was to leave San Francisco. Expect laziness and dysfunction from Egyptians, he told me. IBM in Egypt stood for Inshallah, Bokra, Malesh-God willing, tomorrow, sorry!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>About three dozen people had gathered for the iftar in a private dining room high in the Sofitel hotel on the tip of Zamalek, with a sweeping view of the river. U.S. ambassador Margaret Scobey opened the event by recalling the iftar President Thomas Jefferson had hosted at the White House. She reprised the main themes that President Barack Obama had laid out in a speech in Cairo the previous year, about "a new beginning" for American relations with the Muslim world. But she left out the indelicate parts, like Obama's Quranic admonition to "speak always the truth," or his nod to the universal right "to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My table felt like a scene in a World War I movie where warring generals meet for tea during a break in the battle. The embassy had invited some of Egypt's most notable dissidents and they were seated with me. One was a shaggy-haired, foul-mouthed blogger known for publicizing videos of police abuse and sexual harassment; the security services had recently shut down his website. Another was an Egyptian political scientist at the American University in Cairo who specialized in the defects of Arab authoritarianism. And a third was a researcher for Human Rights Watch. Mubarak kept the organization in a legal limbo, refusing to either fulfill or reject its license application, which meant that at any moment his police could jail its researcher, Heba Morayef.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side of the table were American diplomats and Mubarak officials, all chatting amiably with the dissenters and me. Was I familiar with the figs and soup traditionally served first after a day of fasting, to reawaken digestion? Had I tried kushari, the beloved staple of Egyptian cuisine? (Rice and pasta mixed with lentils and garbanzo beans, flavored by three different sauces at once-vinegar and garlic, tomato, and hot pepper.) Or how about roasted pigeon? It was a delicacy here. We made small talk about politics in Washington and Cairo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So many contradictions hung out in the open in the late summer of 2010. Facebook pages borrowed Silicon Valley marketing techniques to agitate against Mubarak and attracted an audience running into tens of thousands. A left-leaning activist group calling themselves the April 6 Youth Movement, after the date of a wildcat strike at a textile plant, claimed more than seventy thousand online members. But a newspaper columnist who questioned the president's health was sentenced to jail for destabilizing the country. Membership in the Muslim Brotherhood was illegal, but eighty-eight of its members served openly in Parliament. They made up 20 percent of the otherwise docile chamber and constituted Mubarak's only real opposition. Egyptian papers covered the sayings and doings of the Brotherhood's "general guide," a sixty-eight-year-old veterinarian, in the same way the New York tabloids might cover the city's Catholic archbishop (or, for that matter, the way the Egyptian papers covered the pope of Egypt's Coptic Orthodox Church, whose members made up about 10 or 15 percent of the population).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conservatives in the Brotherhood's leadership-including an obscure engineering professor from the Nile Delta named Mohamed Morsi-had recently forced off its governing board their movement's most charismatic moderate, a physician named Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh. But in the summer of 2010 the Brotherhood was collecting signatures for the presidential candidacy of Mohamed ElBaradei, the Noble Prize-winning diplomat who had become the Arab world's best-known liberal. Strange bedfellows. Of course, Mubarak would never allow ElBaradei to run. The state newspapers were busily besmirching him with bogus reports that he had abetted the American invasion of Iraq. One paper published pictures of ElBaradei's daughter in a bikini-a shocking indecency to most Egyptians. ElBaradei's aides found audio surveillance bugs in his office that summer, and the government made almost no attempt to deny or censor reports that intelligence agencies-the mukhabarat-were behind it. I was the only one surprised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one saw any chance that the character of the regime might change any time soon. That is why government officials and prominent dissidents could dine together so comfortably. Yet the daily dysfunction of the state boggled my mind. Fiefdoms within the government bureaucracy sparred publicly with one another. Judges protested that the police threatened their independence. Diplomats rolled their eyes at their geriatric president. And the military and interior ministries more or less openly competed with one another for influence and power. In 1986, several thousand police conscripts had staged an armed insurrection. Army troops fought them with gunfire in city streets and hotel lobbies. Now the gossip buzzing around the embassy iftar was about how much animosity the military commanders felt toward the president's son and heir apparent, forty-six-year-old Gamal Mubarak. He stood to become the first Egyptian head of state from outside the military in fifty-eight years, since Abdel Nasser's Free Officers overthrew the British-backed monarchy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gamal-or Jimmy, as hip Egyptians called him-had gotten rich as an investment banker in London and Cairo. Then his father installed him atop the ruling party and began grooming him for high office. Everybody was doing it. Hafez al-Assad had bequeathed power over Syria to his son. His fellow dictators in Tunisia and Libya were in the process of passing on their jobs to members of their families. Plenty of Arab states were straight-up hereditary monarchies (Jordan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and four of its Persian Gulf neighbors). So why not Gamal? He was pitching himself as the leader for a new generation: the three out of four Egyptians under forty, and the two out of three under thirty-five.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was seated next to a close friend of Gamal's, Tamim Khallaf. He was a diplomat who had gone to college with the researcher for Human Rights Watch. Now he had been seconded by his ministry to help tutor Gamal. Khallaf told me that he had watched the 2008 American presidential election from a fellowship at Harvard, and when he learned I had covered the race he was full of questions. What had happened to Hillary Clinton? Had Sarah Palin hurt John McCain?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had a question for him, too. Would his friend Gamal really run for president to succeed his father in 2011? Khallaf practically winked at me. The Mubaraks were treating the presidential palace as a personal plantation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would later learn that the chief of military intelligence, General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, was in the midst of tackling the same question. Intelligence in the Arab world sometimes includes spying on a head of state himself, and Sisi had reported to the top generals that summer that the president might hand his office to his son as soon as the elder Mubarak's eighty-third birthday, in May 2011. Sisi predicted to the generals that Egyptians would rise up in revolt. Mubarak would respond by ordering the army to quell the unrest. Then the generals would face some decisions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The army had crushed bread riots under President Anwar Sadat in 1977 and the police mutiny under Mubarak in 1986. But the military was a barony of its own. It held the heavy weapons, and its obedience to any civilian was still a matter of choice. Would the generals answer the president's call?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As recently as January 2010, at a ceremony for his promotion to chief of military intelligence, Sisi had publicly praised Mubarak as a father to his country. "Egypt's flag will always continue to fly high under his leadership," Sisi had said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He recommended to the generals just a few months later that they reject Mubarak. Sisi told the generals to declare loyalty to the people, not the president. They should shape their own transition. A modern state might call that treason. But the time was still ripening as we gathered that summer at the iftar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I had skipped lunch. As soon as the sun went down I dived into the hummus, grape leaves, lamb, couscous, and anything else I could reach. The Muslims around me only picked at the food. They were pacing themselves, they told me, for a long night of festive eating. They had just woken up, and they would nap the next day. Night is day and day is night during Ramadan in Cairo.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the middle of the twentieth century, Egypt had led the Arab world to independence from the former colonial powers. It became the wellspring of Arab nationalism, political Islam, and global jihad. Everything in the Arab world had seemed to start in Cairo. Anyone in the region who cared about local politics also followed politics in Cairo. The vibrancy, nightlife, and climate lured the princes of the oil-rich Gulf to holiday at the beaches of Sharm el-Sheikh or the Marriott in Zamalek. The people of neighboring basket cases like Yemen, Jordan, Libya, or the Palestinian territories looked to Egypt as a big brother. Cairo was the place for education and culture, the big time.</p></p><h2>Black Oak 3: Winter Knight</h2><p>Famed investigator Ethan Proctor heads for Pludbury, England, to investigate evidence of a ghost who has been haunting the countryside since the War of the Roses.

Updated and expanded from 2004's Phases of the Moon, this mammoth collection contains twenty-six stories and novellas, along with a generous amount of introductory material. The result is the definitive one-volume overview of an extraordinary career.<br><br>The earliest story, 'The Macauley Circuit,' was published in 1957, the latest, 'The Prisoner,' in 2010. In between these narrative bookends are some of the most astonishing fictional creations of the modern era, many of them winners of major awards. Included among these are 'Good News from the Vatican,' 'Sailing to Byzantium,' 'Passengers,' and 'Enter a Soldier. Later, Enter Another,' as well as two of the most remarkable novellas you will ever encounter: 'Nightwings' and 'Born with the Dead.' Supplementing these award-winners are such bona fide classics as 'Sundance,' 'Schwartz Between the Galaxies,' 'Capricorn Games,' and 'To See the Invisible Man.' And the list goes on. Intelligent, exhilarating, and endlessly re-readable, The Best of Robert Silverberg: Stories of Six Decades is an irreplaceable volume, one that no one with an interest in modern science fiction--or in serious, ambitious fiction of any sort--can afford to miss.</p><p>Starred Review. This well-chosen retrospective, which adds three stories to the 2004 limited-edition collection Phases of the Moon, spans 56 years of SFWA Grand Master Silverberg's writing life, starting in his early career with 1954's The Road to Nightfall and ending with 2010's The Prisoner. In 26 elegantly conceived and written stories, protagonists travel through time, philosophize, question their morals and faith, and pursue unknowable, elusive women. The narrator of Nightwings endures a crisis of faith over his order's age-old vigil against alien invasion. In The Far Side of the Bell-Shaped Curve a time traveler tries to manipulate his time line to keep the woman he desires. A bereaved husband in Born with the Dead pursues his wife beyond death to her very peculiar afterlife. Francisco Pizarro and Socrates engage in a battle of wits in Enter a Soldier. Later, Enter Another. Thanks to Silverberg's commentary on each decade and story&#x2014;wry, candid, and unencumbered by false modesty&#x2014;the anthology also functions as a memoir of a great career in genre literature.

The three victim of the blaze did not die in the fire, but were brutally murdered before the fire even began. With a triple homicide on his hands, Sano's search for a killer leads him to Haru, an orphan girl found at the scene of the crime. But Sano's wife, Reiko, investigating the case against Sano's wishes, is convinced of Haru's innocence. Reiko's investigation leads her behind the walls of the Black Lotus Temple, where she discovers a sect involved in extortion, prostitution, and hedonistic rituals. Could one of the sect's members be the killer? Now Reiko must risk her marriage to Sano in order to prove Haru's innocence...<br><br>Set in the luscious finery of the samurai court of medieval Japan, this latest installment in the bestselling series by Laura Joh Rowland is filled with shocking surprised and suspense as readers are once again allowed access into the world of Sano Ichiro.<br></p><p>Samurai detective Sano Ichiro, the hero of Laura Joh Rowland's beautifully written mysteries set in Shogun-era Japan, (<i>The Samurai's Wife</i>, <i>The Concubine's Tattoo</i>), investigates an arson murder at the Black Lotus temple, in which the only witness--a young girl who swears she doesn't remember what happened--is also the only suspect. But Sano's wife, Reiko, believes that Haru is innocent and that the real culprits are hiding behind the barred gates of the temple, home to a mysterious sect that is rumored to be responsible for a number of criminal acts. Under pressure to solve the crime, Sano agrees to let Reiko help, but when she takes matters into her own hands, it puts his career in jeopardy and nearly destroys their marriage. Who is the mysterious Abbess of the Black Lotus, and what is the sect's real goal? Is Haru the innocent youngster Reiko believes her to be, or does the evidence Sano uncovers reveal her deceitful nature and complicity in the murders of a child, a young woman, and a high-ranking police commander? As usual, Rowland turns in a brilliant re-creation of a time and place unfamiliar to most readers: the imperial court of 17th-century Japan, whose intrigues and excesses provide a fascinating backdrop for the most charming husband and wife detective team since Nick and Nora Charles.

McCord is living with Anne Boleyn in the afterlife but their happiness is, of course, constantly derailed by her obsession with Henry VIII (and the removal of her head at rather inopportune moments). One day McCord meets Dante&#x2019;s Beatrice, who believes there is a way out of Hell, and the next morning, during an exclusive on-camera interview with Satan, McCord realizes that Satan&#x2019;s omniscience, which he has always credited for the perfection of Hell&#x2019;s torments, may be a mirage and Butler is off on a madcap romp about good, evil, free will, and the possibility of escape.

George Michell&#39;s invaluable survey looks at the entire period, covering shrines consecrated to Hindu cults as well as works of art that portray Hindu divinities, semidivine personalities, and mythological narratives. Michell outlines the development of Hinduism and the principal iconic forms of its pantheon (the symbolic basis for Hindu religious architecture), and explains the system of royal patronage that led to the construction of so many temples and the commissioning of their attendant works of art. Then, in a broad chronological sweep, he demonstrates artistic continuities down to the present day in the different regions of the country, confirming the vibrancy of the visual world of Hinduism. The illustrations include Mamallapuram and other great temples, profound and beautiful works of sculpture such as Shiva dancing the eternal dance of creation and destruction, and exquisite paintings of the loves of Krishna. 185 illustrations, 100 in color.</p><p>George Michell is the author of <i>The Royal Palaces of India</i>, published by Thames &amp; Hudson.The newest book in this familiar paperback series on world art is a sweeping survey of Hindu architecture and sculpture in India. With only a few examples of the Hindu artworks of Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, it bypasses the artistic glories of Hinduism outside of India, particularly in Cambodia and Indonesia. The book's other notable shortcoming is its relative paucity of two-dimensional works, both the exquisite miniatures that Indian art (both Hindu and Muslim) is renowned for and the lurid popular prints that are such a part of Indian daily life today. That said, Michell (The Royal Palaces of India) has compiled a dense and well-illustrated chronological guide to the development of Hindu architecture and sculpture in many diverse regions of India. With an excellent map featuring all of the sites mentioned in the text, an extensive glossary combined with the index, and a bibliography for further exploration of both art and religion, this book is particularly suited to readers unfamiliar with Hinduism and Hindu art.

Little do they know that mystery awaits!When Claudia decided to run away, she planned very carefully. She would be gone for just long enough to teach her parents a lesson in Claudia appreciation. And she would live in comfort -- at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She invited her brother Jamie to go, too, mostly because he was a miser and would have money.<p> The two took up residence in the museum right on schedule. But once the fun of settling in was over, Claudia had two unexpected problems; she felt just the same, and she wanted to feel different; and she found a statue at the museum so beautiful she could not go home until she had discovered its maker, a question that baffled even the experts. The former owner of the statue was Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. And without her help Claudia might never have found a way to go home.</p></p><h2>What Cats Teach Us: Life&#39;s Lessons Learned from Our Feline Friends</h2><p>Fresh on the heels of the successful What Dogs Teach Us, author Dromgoole offers the insightful What Cats Teach Us. Cats, best known for their disapproving attitudes towards humans, still have much to teach. From keeping fastidious grooming habits, eating a healthy fish diet and getting plenty of rest, to nurturing your independent spirit, expressing your individuality and embracing your curiosity, What Cats Teach Us reminds us of what in life is important to avoid, defend, cherish and enjoy.</p><p>A full-color, page-by-page guide to adapting the cats qualities to our own to live a healthier and happier life (companion to WHAT DOGS TEACH US, August 1999).Glenn Dromgoole is a 30-year veteran editor and reporter.

Yet, during this brief period, religion underwent great changes that affected everyone: clergy and laypeople, men and women, Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. The 'Reigns of Terror' of the Revolution drove the Church underground, permanently altering the relationship between Church and State.</p><p>In this book, Nigel Aston offers a readable guide to these tumultuous events. While the structures and beliefs of the Catholic Church are central, it does not neglect minority groups like Protestants and Jews. Among other features, the book discusses the Constitutional Church, the end of state support for Catholicism, the 'Dechristianization' campaign and the Concordat of 1801-2.</p><p>Key themes discussed include the capacity of all the Churches for survival and adaptation, the role of religion in determining political allegiances during the Revolution, and the turbulence of Church-State relations.</p><p>In this masterly study, based on the latest evidence, Aston sheds new light on a dynamic period in European history and its impact on the next 200 years of religious life in France.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><br><p>Nigel Aston is senior lecturer in modern history at the University of Luton.</p><p>PRAISE FOR THE BOOK:</p><br><p>"As a synthesis both of recent work and of older studies in religious history, it is a tour de force. . . . The great contribution of this book is to the history of the French Revolution, and here the picture of events that emerges from Aston's account is in certain respects an unfamiliar one. . . . Those of us who teach courses on Enlightenment and French Revolution, as well as general readers wanting a detailed, well-written synthesis of the religious history of this complex period, are very much in Nigel Aston's debt."&#x2015;<i>H-France Reviews</i></p><p>"A comprehensive survey of the religious history of France from the eve of the Revolution through the early years of the nineteenth century. It is work of great erudition, drawing on an immense array of secondary materials and printed sources. . . . The book is undoubtedly the best general study of religion in the French Revolution to appear in English since John McManner's short synthesis of 1968."&#x2015;<i>Catholic Historical Review</i></p><p>"This will be the book on the subject. It is based on a great deal of the author's own primary research on the topic, and draws on an enormous body of secondary sources.

[His] fine and valuable book is . . . the first comprehensive history of religion and the French Revolution to appear in English. . . . A fine and highly important and useful book. Strongly recommended for inclusion in all libraries, academic or public, that have any interest in either the history of the French Revolution or post-Enlightenment religion."&#x2015;<i>History: Reviews of New Books</i></p><br><p></p><br><p> "Aston's study promises to be extremely useful for scholars of Jews in the modern period. The author strikes a nice balance between synthesis and detail in achieving an extremely readable summary of the large literature on Christianity and the Revolution. Scholars of the Haskalah interested in parallel movements within French Christianity will thus find this text an extremely convenient starting point. Moreover, Aston deserves special praise for making an effort to normalize the history of Protestants and Jews by including them alongside the Catholic Church."&#x2015;Alyssa Goldstein Sepinwall, <i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i></p></p><p>Nigel Aston is senior lecturer in modern history at the University of Luton."This will be the book on the subject.

For such students, these are skills that cannot just be absorbed from experience but need to be taught. In her accessible book Michelle Garcia Winner offers teaching techniques to help students identify and overcome their weaknesses, leading to the acquisition of skills such as initiating conversations or activities; listening and attending; understanding abstract language; taking others&#39; perspectives; seeing the big picture and using humor. Winner demonstrates how to break down these skills into manageable concepts and suggests methods of teaching them so that the student can truly understand not just what to do but also why. Clearly written and easily readable, the book contains many photo copyable worksheets for teachers&#39; use, and will be indispensable to educators and therapists working with young people with social-cognitive deficits.</p><p></p><h2>Freedom from Addiction Workbook</h2><p>Tens of thousands of Christians are locked into the cycle of addiction--particularly in the areas of alcohol and drug abuse.

Before long, a sinister creature lures the kids&#39; mom through a door in the basement. Em and Navin, desperate not to lose her, follow her into an underground world inhabited by demons, robots, and talking animals.Eventually, they enlist the help of a small mechanical rabbit named Miskit. Together with Miskit, they face the most terrifying monster of all, and Em finally has the chance to save someone she loves.</p><p>Kazu Kibuishi is the founder and editor of the critically acclaimed Flight anthologies, as well as the creator of COPPER. He lives in Alhambra, California, with his wife and fellow comics artist, Amy Kim Kibuishi, and their son. Visit him online at www.boltcity.com.Almost too clever and poignant, <i>Amulet</i> is, on the surface, about navigating the murky waters of adolescence and, beneath that, an exploration of abandonment and survival. Emily and Navin are lost children, literally lost in a dark, new world and struggling to save their mother, who has been kidnapped by a drooling, tentacled beast. With stellar artwork, imaginative character design, moody color and consistent pacing, this first volume's weakness lies in its largely disjointed storytelling. There is the strong, young, heroine; cute, furry, sidekicks; scary monsters&#x2014;all extraordinary components, but pieced together in a patchwork manner. There is little hope in his dark world as Kibuishi removes Emily and Navin's frame of safety. Their hopes rest in a magic amulet that seems to be working in the interest of the children&#x2014;until it suddenly isn't. The most frightening element of <i>Amulet</i> is the sense of insecurity we feel for Emily, fighting her way through uncharted terrain with no guide and no support system. This first volume of <i>Amulet</i> isn't a disappointment, but it does feel like a warmup to the main event. If anything, it's a clear indication that Kibuishi has just begun skimming the surface of his own talent. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Chenango provided a water link between Binghamton in the southern tier and Utica, a major port on the Erie some 90 miles from its eastern terminus at Albany. Like the Erie, the Chenango brought prosperity to the region through which it ran, forged new industries in the canal towns, lowered freight rates, and reduced hauling time. Chief Engineer John B. Jervis of Rome, one of the Erie builders, provided leadership for a construction task that involved 97 miles of canal and 116 locks, along with numerous feeders, reservoirs, dams and aqueducts, and over 200 bridges of various uses. It shut down in 1878, after many years of financial, political, and public contraversies; but during its heyday, the Chenango was a proud part of the state&#39;s inland waterway transportation system.</p><p>Michele McFee is on the board of directors of the Canal Society of New York State and an archival assistant at Binghamton University.

Accompanied by an old man haunted by memories of the war; an amorous dog named Sammy Davis, Junior, Junior; and the unforgettable Alex, a young Ukrainian translator who speaks in a sublimely butchered English, Jonathan is led on a quixotic journey over a devastated landscape and into an unexpected past.</p></p><p>The simplest thing would be to describe <i>Everything Is Illuminated</i>, Jonathan Safran Foer's accomplished debut, as a novel about the Holocaust. It is, but that really fails to do justice to the sheer ambition of this book. The main story is a grimly familiar one. A young Jewish American--who just happens to be called Jonathan Safran Foer--travels to the Ukraine in the hope of finding the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. He is aided in his search by Alex Perchov, a na�ve Ukrainian translator, Alex's grandfather (also called Alex), and a flatulent mongrel dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. On their journey through Eastern Europe's obliterated landscape they unearth facts about the Nazi atrocities and the extent of Ukrainian complicity that have implications for Perchov as well as Safran Foer. This narrative is not, however, recounted from (the character) Jonathan Safran Foer's perspective. It is relayed through a series of letters that Alex sends to Foer. These are written in the kind of broken Russo-English normally reserved for Bond villains or Latka from <i>Taxi</i>. Interspersed between these letters are fragments of a novel by Safran Foer--a wonderfully imagined, almost magical realist, account of life in the shtetl before the Nazis destroyed it. These are in turn commented on by Alex, creating an additional metafictional angle to the tale. <p> If all this sounds a little daunting, don't be put off; Safran Foer is an extremely funny as well as intelligent writer who combines some of the best Jewish folk yarns since Isaac Bashevis Singer with a quite heartbreaking meditation on love, friendship, and loss. <i>--Travis Elborough, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Harper Perennial paperback, 2003Previous ISBN 978-0060529703</p><h2>Sweepers</h2><p>The U.S. Navy made him the ultimate killer.

Days later, a U.S. gunboat returns to pick him up, but the boat&#39;s young captain, Lt. William Sherman, panics under fire and leaves the SEAL behind. Twenty years later: Lieutenant Sherman is now a Pentagon admiral. When a beautiful woman is found dead in her home, and Admiral Sherman comes under suspicion, Navy Commander Karen Lawrence is assigned to conduct her own inquiry. With the help of a seasoned investigator and ex-Marine, &#34;Train&#34; von Rensel, Karen finds herself confronting a Pentagon hierarchy determined to avoid scandal - even at the cost of the truth. The pressure builds when yet another friend of the admiral is found dead under mysterious circumstances, and it becomes apparent that the SEAL is back. But he is no longer a SEAL; he is a sweeper, an intelligence specialist who cleans things up when covert operations go wrong. Only this time, he is on a mission of personal revenge.

Beyond its dis�tinction as the largest unincorporated community in New Mexico, it is an area where the land and the his�tory have many stories to tell. The geology tells a tale of exploding volcanoes. The ruins and artifacts tell of people living in the area for tens of thousands of years&#x2014;the Anasazi and Pueblo natives over a thousand years ago, the Spanish explorers long before the English founded James�town or Plymouth. The flags of four countries have flown over New Mexico. An important battle of the Civil War was fought near Eldorado. More recently, the land has brought people from many places with its lure of open space, clean air, sparkling stars in clear night skies, beautiful vistas, and incredible sunsets. As these modern settlers have built homes here, the area has grown and changed, capping the history that Windmills and Dreams describes. This is more than just a book of facts, though. It is a manifestation and clear example of the &#x201c;pride of place&#x201d; that so many local residents justifiably feel. It is the hope of this book&#x2019;s creators that Windmills and Dreams will help you learn and appreciate more about Eldorado at Santa Fe.</p><p></p><h2>Just the Right Home (Reader&#39;s Clubhouse Level 2 Reader)</h2><p>This is volume seven, Reading Level 2, in a comprehensive program (Reading Levels 1 and 2)for beginning readers.Two nine-book sets teach reading to children from preschool to grades K and 1, emphasizing phonics while also presenting a lively and engaging collection of facts and stories to make kids&#39; reading experiences enjoyable.

Short vowel families are covered in Level 1 readers and long vowel families in the Level 2 books. Fiction titles feature attractive illustrations and have story themes ranging from funny to serious. Each fiction title also suggests a brief activity that allows kids to interact with the book&#39;s subject matter. Nonfiction titles are photo illustrated, and include &#34;Fun Facts&#34; to enrich children&#39;s reading experiences. The nonfiction books contain the basic elements of a nonfiction book, including glossary and index. They also suggest web sites appropriate to kids&#39; interests where more information about each book&#39;s subject is offered. Both fiction and nonfiction titles contain word lists that group each book&#39;s words into &#34;decodable&#34; words--those containing the book&#39;s main vowel sound, which the book is either teaching or reviewing. Word lists also include high-frequency words and challenging words included in the main text. All books present a letter to parents and teachers explaining the fundamental concepts underlying both the series and the specific title.

The majority of the stories may be generally classified as "historical fiction," but, more precisely, they are extremely well-researched forays into remote geographical areas and little-known periods of history. </p><p>The title story, "Lou-lan," recounts the turbulent history and final disappearance of an ancient city in Central Asia. "The Sage" and "Princess Yung-t'ai's Necklace" also recreate the tempestuous past of continental Asia. The remaining three stories--"The Opaline Cup," "Passage to Fudaraku," and "The Rhododendrons"--are set in Japan. The first of these is about a pair of cups that were treasured by an ancient king and are brought together after being separated for over a thousand years. The second is a narrative centering around a custom that arose in a remote Buddhist temple, whereby the abbot was cast adrift in a boat to die at sea. And the third is a masterly characterization of an old scholar reminiscing about his life.</p></p><p>Yasushi Inoue was born in 1907 in Hokkaido, the son of an army medical officer. He graduated from Kyoto University in 1936, and joined the staff of Mainichi Newspapers as a reporter. In 1948 he published his first novels, The Hunting Gun and , which won him the Akutagawa Prize, a much coveted literary award. He is also the author of numerous works of historical fiction, and among his best known are Wind and Waves, The Emperor Go-Shirakawa, A Strange Tale of Russia, and Tun-huang, which has been translated into English. In 1976 Inoue was decorated with the Cultural Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Japanese government. He died in 1991.[The following excerpt is from the title story, "Lou-lan."] <p>The next morning the soldiers of Charkhlik heard a strange howling. The wind had risen again, but it was not the wind they heard. It was a sound that came through the wind. </p><p>The young leader ordered a soldier to a tower. Just then the first arrow hit the side of a building and fell into the street. It was a long arrow, and after it a shower of arrows fell upon the stone paving. They came from a considerable distance, but it was not possible to determine the direction. Blown by the fierce wind, they struck the ground almost horizontally. The soldier came down from the tower. The air was black with sand, and he had been able to see nothing. The leader himself went up the tower, but it was as the man had said. </p><p>The wind howled through a sky dark as night, and with it came that other sound--the angry howling of Lop Nor. The leader would probably have seen it the day before if he had gone a little farther. </p><p>He came down from the tower. The rain of arrows was heavier and the strange noise seemed nearer. He marched his men toward the gate, since they would be at a disadvantage fighting a large enemy within the walls. They were not quite fast enough, however. At the guardhouse they came upon a strangely clad troop making its way in. The soldiers of Charkhlik faced the enemy there inside the gate. Each with a long sword in hand, the men of the strangely clad troop feinted and lunged at them. </p><p>The soldiers of Charkhlik answered with their long spears. Sand began to descend on the battlefield like a waterfall. Both sides had to stop fighting. They could not keep their eyes open, and the sand penetrated the smallest holes in their armor. </p><p>The wind grew yet fiercer and the sand yet thicker. The sun was hidden, and the fighters could hardly make one another out. </p><p>The young leader had finally pushed his way through the gate with a number of followers. They could go no farther. The sandstorm was even worse than within the city. The soldiers of Charkhlik one by one joined their leader, and the band lay huddled against the wall. With them were a number of enemy soldiers who had been unable to go inside. The neighing of hundreds of ponies and the crying of camels came through the howling wind and waves. </p><p>The wind howled on for three days and three nights. Men and horses and camels were buried in the sand. The wall of the city was half buried. </p><p>The fighting had stopped as though it had never started. The soldiers of Charkhlik and the second invaders spent three days fighting sand instead. </p><p>When the wind died down on the fourth day, the young Charkhlik leader withdrew from the town, leaving scores of his followers buried in the sand. The other troop too left the little citadel in the desert, many of its number taken by the sand.</p></p><h2>JSA: The Liberty Files</h2><p>Batman and other superheroes battle supervillains during World War II and the Cold War, in a variation of the standard comic-book reality.</p><p>The first generation of superheroes arrived just in time for World War II. To that era Jolley and Harris return, but not quite, for they conjure a world subtly different than even standard comic-book reality. Batman is called in to help two other costumed crime fighters apprehend Jack the Grin (i.e., the Joker), thought to be carrying plans for a German superweapon. The mission is accomplished, and the captured document indicates that the Nazis have a "super-man." Fortunately, Uncle Sam also has a superman--namely, Superman, though he is top secret. He <i>has</i> a secret, too: the reason he was sent, or, rather, expelled, to Earth. The action stays hot and heavy, through WWII and into cold war H-bomb espionage. Batman and peers encounter several horrifying supervillains, capped by their most dangerous opponent ever. This Batman is a domineering, rather paranoid good guy in a dangerous world that Harris' active compositions and sharp lines, colored in dark shades lit by explosions, make more exciting than, to date, Batman movies have been. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Cat lovers rejoice?Nero (named for his all black fur) Corleone (meaning Lionheart) is born on an Italian farm ready to enter hearts and homes. Within a short time, his fellow barnmates call him Don (sir)?an indication of his potential and somewhat alarming leadership abilities. He takes care of his littermate, timid Rosa, and together they discover the warm hearth of Isolde and Robert, unsuspecting human vacationers. Quickly wrapped around Nero's formidable white paw, the couple returns to their German homeland with the cats in tow. The story continues with Rosa gaining confidence and Nero finding an adoring mate, Kleistie. The years go by happily until the death of Rosa and the departure of Kleistie. Nero must ultimately decide whether to return to his native farm or to stay with Isolde and Robert.

"In every age," writes Myers, "disciples despair that the story has ended, only to discover that the stone 'has been rolled away,' reopening the possibility - and imperative - of following the Way of Jesus."<br>As a sequel to Binding the Strong Man, Who Will Roll Away the Stone? brings Myers' study of the gospel of Mark full circle. The first book provided a compelling reading of Mark's gospel as a manual of radical discipleship in the ancient Roman empire. Who Will Roll Away the Stone? picks up and extends the gospel's challenge specifically to those living in the contemporary imperial context.<br>Each chapter opens with classic questions from within the gospel itself. Beginning with Peter's denial of Jesus, Who Will Roll Away the Stone? shows how and why first-world Christians - politically free, socially mobile, and resource-rich - seem typically unable or unwilling to struggle for social change. Myers uses three of the most troubling and problematic of recent events - the Los Angeles riots, the Gulf War, the Columbus quincentennial - to demonstrate how the subtle complexities of a culture of technological wizardy, information overload, and short-term memory can be recognized as blocking the first step on the journey of discipleship.<br>Myers then turns to the second stage of discipleship which is conversion, literally a call to change direction both as individuals and as a society. He continues with a "deconstruction" of the modus vivendi of U.S. culture, using experiments in other ways of living, including social relocation and nonviolent politics. He then moves into the third stage of the call to discipleship, to reconstruct the church and the world through positive action: building solidarity with one another and with the poor, accepting and celebrating diversity and its gifts, and reclaiming the discourse of the reign of God from those who use it to defend the status quo.</p><p>Chad Myers serves on the staff of the American Friends Service Committee in Los Angeles.</p><h2>X-Men: Phoenix - Warsong</h2><p>The Phoenix is back!

The eccentric &#x2015; albeit slightly overly-friendly &#x2015; landlord seems nice and welcoming enough, the ceilings are high, and all of the other tenants are also girls. Things aren't great, but they're stable. Or at least that's what she tells herself when she impulsively hands over enough money to cover the first month's rent and decides to give it a go. </p><p>But soon after she becomes uneasy about her rash decision. She hears things in the night. Feels them. Things...or people...who aren't there in the light. Who couldn't be there, because after-all, her door is locked every night, and the key is still in place in the morning. Concern soon turns to terror when the voices she hears and presence she feels each night become hostile. It's clear that something very bad has happened in this house. And something even worse is happening now. Stephanie has to find a way out, before whatever's going on in the house finds her first. </p><p>Adam Nevill's<i> No One Gets Out Alive</i> will chill you straight through to the core &#x2015; a cold, merciless, fear-inducing nightmare to the last page.

She concludes with an examination of the individual&#x2019;s response to the mystery of the Divine. Based on both original classical sources and modern literature, as well as the author&#x2019;s considerable personal experience, this is not only a fascinating survey of Islamic practices and beliefs, but also a broad and intregrated overview of the phenomenology of Islam.</p><p>&#39;This is one of Schimmel&#39;s most important books.

The Puritans were a group of such ministers whose teaching and living can be particularly encouraging to troubled and discouraged pastors today. They were steadfast in adhering to Scripture as the Word of God, in confessing the great truths of the Reformed faith, and in applying sound doctrine to the problems of life in an age and culture nearly as challenging as our own. In <i>Encouragement for Today's Pastors</i>, Joel R. Beeke and Terry D. Slachter examine the writings of these pastors of a bygone era consider how they can help struggling pastors today. Here pastors will find a helping hand, reminding them of the importance of cultivating personal piety, resting in God's sovereignty recovering clarity in their calling, discovering means of support God provided, recognizing the dignity of their office, and taking comfort in grace and glory to come. <p> <b>Table of Contents:</b> <br> Part One: Piety <br> 1.

The very news of their coming can lift the spirits of a church with anticipation and then their actual ministries, both privately and publicly, can renew the aspirations of young and old in Christ. Full of faith and the Holy Spirit, these people are the means under God of building up the morale of wilting congregations, giving them courage and making God&#39;s people feel they can stand, and they can go on, and that they will indeed overcome a time of heaviness. Such Christian leaders are inspirational men and their ministries make people feel strong. Of course it is God who gives such gifts to them to do this. The same Spirit that came upon Barnabas and made him a son of encouragement is upon them, and hundreds like them in our day. But as in all the stewardship of preaching and pastoral graces, such a gift needs to be refined, educated, and stirred up. This is one of the grand benefits that comes from the careful and prayerful reading of this book. You owe it to the people of God to become a son or daughter of encouragement. It is an exercise of Christian prudence, and an energizing ministry of the Spirit of God to do this in you and through you to the body of Christ.&#34; Geoff Thomas, pastor of Alfred Place Baptist Church, Aberystwyth, WalesJoel R.

In O Come Ye Back to Ireland, they chronicled their first year. Here they continue the account of their lives as novice farmers in County Clare, describing their successes and failures, the crops and animals they learn to nurture, and the caring neighbors who are always ready to help and instruct. Most poignantly, they tell of their bitter disappointment at learning that they cannot have a child of their own, and of the difficult decision to begin the adoption process. At the heart of the book is the story of a year of waitingwaiting to be approved by the Irish Adoption Board, waiting for a baby, waiting for the baby to be legally theirs. When Deirdre is finally their own and the farm begins to thrive, their contentment is complete. This is the unassuming tale of two people who return to the land and succeed. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The authors made their debut with O Come Ye Back to Ireland ( LJ 10/15/87), a quaint account of their first year in Ireland after moving from the Big Apple. This sequel is equally successful. It focuses on the couple's attempt to adopt a child. Though they recount various incidents--the shock of a return trip to New York, the scare of a major storm hitting western Ireland--the pending adoption overrides all other concerns. Still, they go on with their pastoral lives: farming, tending livestock, the sharing of a community spirit not found in New York City. Breen and Williams have used a unique format in both books. The text is primarily the product of Williams, while the narrative is interspersed with entries from Breen's diary. Another charming account; recommended for most libraries.<br><i>- Boyd Childress, Auburn Univ .

Years earlier, Uhura had befriended a diplomat from Eeiauo, and the two women had exchanged songs as an intimate bond, swearing never to reveal them to anyone. But the only hope for a cure may lie in the song given to Uhura, and they must penetrate its layers of mystery if there&#39;s any hope for Eeiauo, or the Enterprise.</p><p><p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> <i>Captain's Log,</i> Stardate 2950.3: </p><p> The <i>Enterprise</i> continues in orbit around Eeiauo, on the outermost fringe of Federation space. At McCoy's recommendation, Starfleet has placed the world under quarantine. The <i>Enterprise</i> will remain here to enforce that quarantine until the arrival of a Federation task force, specialists in epidemiology and in enforcement. </p><p> Dr. McCoy and Nurse Chapel have elected to beam down with the medical team we transported to aid the Eeiauoans in their desperate fight against the plague that is devastating their world -- a plague they call "The Long Death." </p><p> <i>Personal Log,</i> James T. Kirk, Stardate 2950.3: </p><p> Bones, at least, has something useful to do. Ile rest of us can only sit and listen, as more and more Eeiauoans are struck down. Over a quarter of the population now has ADF syndrome. If only the Eeiauoans had asked for help sooner! </p><p> I told Bones of our frustration. His response was predictable... </p><p> <i>"You're</i> frustrated! By God, Jim!" McCoy let his exasperated words hang for a moment, then he stepped slightly to one side. </p><p> "<i>Bozhe moi,"</i> breathed Pavel Chekov as he watched the viewscreen; it was nothing less than a prayer. To Kirk's right, Lieutenant Uhura gave a small wordless gasp. </p><p> Even a clinical knowledge of ADF syndrome left Jim Kirk unprepared for the view behind McCoy. Consciously, he knew the miles that separated him from the scene, but he was still hard put not to take an involuntary step backward. </p><p> He saw row after row after row of the circular Eeiauoan hospital beds, each one occupied. The victims of ADF were no longer recognizably Eeiauoan: they lay as if dead, their furless bodies covered with raw, oozing lesions. From Bones's briefing, Jim Kirk knew that, given adequate intravenous feeding and similar maintenance, they could survive in this state for years. <i>If you call this survival,</i> he thought. Seeing them, he didn't. </p><p> Those in the early, ambulatory stage of the disease hunched in their pain, brushed away their loosening fur and carried on the work of maintaining the others. </p><p> The Eeiauoans had not asked the Federation for assistance until they no longer had the power to help themselves. </p><p> McCoy blocked the view again. </p><p> "Sorry, Bones," Kirk said, when he found his voice. "That was a stupid thing for me to say." </p><p> McCoy shook his head. "The Eeiauoan doctors have dealt with two previous outbreaks of ADF syndrome and never bothered to call in Federation help before. It wasn't bad enough, they tell me. Wasn't bad enough! Jim, they lost twenty thousand people in the last one!" He himself looked on the verge of collapse, but Kirk was relieved to see that he still had the energy for righteous indignation. </p><p> "Are you making any progress, Bones?" </p><p> McCoy snorted. "'Progress.' If that's a polite way of askin' have we found a cure yet, the answer is no. Nor have we cobbled together a vaccine in our copious spare time. Give me all the time in the world and the greatest scientists and doctors in history and even then I couldn't promise you results, dammit. I can't <i>command</i> a scientific breakthrough." </p><p> He drew a long breath, his shoulders slumped. "I wish to hell I could. They're good people." With a flash of his old humor, he added, " -- for overgrown house cats." </p><p> "Is there anything we can do, anything at all?" </p><p> "You're supposed to be enforcin' the quarantine, not breakin' it. No, I don't want anyone else down here. The best you could do is carry bedpans, and robots do that well enough. And they, at least, are immune to ADF syndrome." </p><p> "Bones, when was the last time you heard of a disease that affects two species as different as humans and Eeiauoans?" </p><p> "Rabies," said McCoy curtly. At Kirk's questioning look, he added, by way of explanation, "An ancient Earth disease -- it did indeed affect two species as different as..." He waved his hand. "The planet's under quarantine, Jim, and I don't want to hear any more about it." </p><p> A tall Eeiauoan tapped McCoy lightly on the shoulder with a claw tip. He turned. "Yes, Quickfoot?" </p><p> Quickfoot of Srallansre, the Eeiauoan doctor McCoy had been working with since their arrival, was obviously in the first stage of ADF syndrome. Each movement she made was stiff with pain. Her gray-striped fur was already thinning and dingy. Her nictitating membranes, discolored and swollen, partially obstructed her vision. Although she did not yet have the characteristic pained hunched posture, Kirk suspected it was from force of will only. </p><p> McCoy accepted a sheaf of papers from her. "Get some rest, dammit, Quickfoot," he said irritably. "Finish that later." </p><p> Quickfoot shook her head stiffly. "Too ssoon, too much resst, McCCoy. Work <i>now.</i> There is no <i>later."</i> She limped away. </p><p> McCoy wiped his face and eyes. "Damn cat hair," he muttered, "gets in everything." Kirk nodded, accepting the fiction. After a pause, McCoy straightened and said, "I have some more information for Mr. Spock." </p><p> Casting a quick, puzzled glance at his chief science officer, Kirk said, "I thought we transhipped a hold fun of medical computers?" </p><p> McCoy muttered a response. </p><p> "How's that, Bones?" Jim Kirk was quite sure he had heard McCoy correctly -- but baiting McCoy was a habit of long standing and seemed to restore a measure of normality even in such grotesque circumstances as these. </p><p> McCoy scowled. "I said," and this time he enunciated each word clearly, "I'd rather trust Spock." </p><p> At Spock's raised eyebrow, McCoy scowled again. Then, very rapidly, to change the subject, he said, "How's Sulu?" </p><p> The forced inaction these past few weeks had given everyone time to return to hobbies or create new ones from sheer desperation. Sulu had found McCoy's substitute, Dr. Evan Wilson, a fencing partner his equal -- or better. Hard-pressed during a recent match with her, he had tripped and, against all odds, broken his ankle. </p><p> The thought of Wilson touched a nerve. Privately, Jim Kirk resented her presence on behalf of the <i>Enterprise's</i> own medical staff. It was not the first time Starfleet Command had shown such a lack of judgment however, and he was not about to mention his feelings in public. Morale was low enough already; it would not do to have his crew questioning their acting chief medical officer. He said, "Sulu's fine. Dr. Wilson says he'll be up and around in no time." </p><p> "'Up and around'? How did she get him to stay down?" </p><p> Until Bones's question, it hadn't occurred to him to wonder. Jim Kirk spread his hands and glanced at his chief science officer inquiringly. </p><p> Spock said, "I believe she learned her bedside manner from you, Doctor." </p><p> "What d'you mean by that, Spock?" </p><p> "I mean, Dr. McCoy, that she used a purely emotional approach." Spock's features were innocent of expression. </p><p> Now openly suspicious, McCoy growled, "I'm waiting, Mr. Spock." </p><p> Spock raised an eyebrow, presumably at McCoy's display of impatience, then said, "Dr. Wilson was heard to tell Mr. Sulu that if he did not stay off his injured leg, she would -- I quote -- break the other one for him." </p><p> Jim Kirk gave an inward cheer. He could not have delivered the tale half so well himself, and for the life of him, he couldn't tell if Spock had done it intentionally. </p><p> Intentional or not, the story, or Spock's delivery, actually brought a surprised chuckle from McCoy. He gave Spock a wary look, then turned back to Kirk, and said, "Feisty little thing, isn't she? Keep your eye on her, Jim. What she lacks in height, she makes up in brass. Get her to tell you how Scotty and I met her. Might give you a laugh and, God knows, we could all use a few." </p><p> Then his brief smile faded and there was a long moment's silence. Kirk could see McCoy's mind turning back to the desperateness of the problem he faced.

His books continue to be bestsellers, despite his death in 1990, and total UK sales are now 55 million worldwide! Quentin Blake is one of the best-known and best-loved children&#39;s illustrators and it&#39;s impossible now to think of Roald Dahl&#39;s writings without imagining Quentin Blake&#39;s illustrations.This celebrated, splendidly matched author-illustrator team here present a 64-page love story that is equally sweet and silly. For years, Mr. Hoppy has leaned over his balcony rail to gaze longingly at Mrs. Silver, who lives one floor below him. But all of her attention and affection is showered upon her pet tortoise, Alfie. Although the creature seems content, his devoted owner is concerned because he has gained a mere three ounces in the 11 years she has owned him. When the distressed Mrs. Silver tells her neighbor that she will be his "slave for life" if he can find a way to make Alfie grow, the determined Mr. Hoppy devises an elaborate scheme to make her think the tortoise is growing. (Since tortoises, according to Mr. Hoppy, are backward creatures that "can only understand words that are written backwards," his exhortation to the pet begins "Esio Trot"--which is "tortoise" reversed.) It is a happy Hoppy who gets all the credit--and Mrs. Silver's hand. Adults and older children will appreciate Dahl's superior storytelling skills, and will chuckle at Blake's animated, cartoony drawings.

Turner&#39;s The Fighting Temeraire Tugged to her Last Berth to be Broken Up (1838) was his masterpiece, and in a recent BBC Radio 4 poll to find the nation&#39;s favourite painting it won by a landslide, receiving over a quarter of all votes cast and fighting off Constable&#39;s The Hay Wain and other equally well-known works by Manet, Hockney and Van Gogh. Sam Willis tells the real-life story behind this remarkable painting. The 98-gun Temeraire warship broke through the French and Spanish line directly astern of Nelson&#39;s flagship Victory during the Battle of Trafalgar (1805), saving Nelson at a crucial moment in the battle, and, in the words of John Ruskin, fought until her sides ran &#39;wet with the long runlets of English blood those pale masts that stayed themselves up against the war-ruin, shaking out their ensigns through the thunder, till sail and ensign dropped.&#39; It is a story that unites the art of war as practised by Nelson with the art of war as depicted by Turner and, as such, it ranges across an extensive period of Britain&#39;s cultural and military history in ways that other stories do not. The result is a detailed picture of British maritime power at two of its most significant peaks in the age of sail: the climaxes of both the Seven Years&#39; War (1756-63) and the Napoleonic Wars (1798-1815). It covers every aspect of life in the sailing navy, with particular emphasis on amphibious warfare, disease, victualling, blockade, mutiny and, of course, fleet battle, for it was at Trafalgar that the Temeraire really won her fame. An evocative and magnificent narrative history by a master historian.</p><p>Sam Willis has lectured at Bristol University and at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, and consults on maritime painting for Christie&#39;s. Sam spent eighteen months as a Square Rig Able Seaman, sailing the tall ships used in the Hornblower television series and Channel 4&#39;s award-winning film Shackleton, and is a consultant to the BBC&#39;s Coast. He is the author of Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare and the highly successful Fighting Ships series for Quercus.&#39;Absorbing and enjoyable biography . He (Sam Willis) is a reliable and readable guide to the naval history embodied in the Temeraire. His book cleverly uses the microcosm of the life story of one ship to reflect the wider narrative of the decades-long struggle between Britain and France for mastery of the seas.&#39; Sunday Times. &#39;The author has dealt with his subject on many enthralling levels from the horrific accounts of warfare at sea, through the mutiny at Bantry Bay to the ship&#39;s eventual decommissioning and use as a prison hulk&#39; Irish Examiner. &#39;An absorbing and enjoyable biography&#39; French News.</p><h2>Code Geass: Suzaku of the Counterattack, Vol. 2 (v. 2)</h2><p>Based on the acclaimed anime series as seen on Adult Swim from writer&#39;s Goro Taniguichi and Ichiro Okouchi, with original character designs by the manga powerhouse CLAMP!

H. Lawrence, Geoff Dyer finds himself compelled to write about anything else. He is in fact compelled to do more or less anything else instead of write. In Sicily he is too preoccupied by his hatred of seafood to follow the great writer's footsteps; in Mexico he cannot get beyond a drug-induced erotic fantasy on a nudist beach, and yet, incredibly, this attempt to write a "sober academic study" reveals the hold Lawrence and his work still exert on us today. <i>Out of Sheer Rage</i> is a complete one-off, a richly comic study of the combination of bad temper, procrastination, and the uncanny power of obliquity.</p><p><i>Out of Sheer Rage: Wrestling with D.H. Lawrence</i> is the best book about not writing a book about D.H Lawrence ever written. Other people have written untraditional, even loopy tributes to the priest of love before--including boon companions Anais Nin and Henry Miller--but no one has done it with Dyer's chutzpah, or with such fantastic success.<p> Dyer started out with the intention of writing either a sober academic study of Lawrence or a novel based on his subject's life but couldn't seem to do either. The academic study, he realized, was really just an excuse to read Lawrence's work, and the novel never even acquired a rudimentary shape in his mind. Instead, he somehow convinced his publisher to pick up the tab for his lengthy globetrotting pilgrimage, which took him from Paris to Rome to Greece to Oxford--not to mention such Lawrentian hotspots as Taos and Mexico and San Francisco. The result is an extended, often hilarious, meditation on seafood, English TV, Dyer's own creative impulses, and occasionally even Lawrence.</p><p> In Lawrence's seminal prose he finds some justification for his own capricious indulgences: "What Lawrence's life demonstrates so powerfully is that it actually takes a daily effort to be free.... There are intervals of repose but there will never come a state of definitive rest where you can give up because you have turned freedom into a permanent condition. Freedom is always precarious." Yet he refuses to read Lawrence's novels, confining himself to letters, travel reportage, and other casuals. Indeed, "[o]ne gets so weary watching authors' sensations and thoughts get novelised, set into the concrete of fiction, that perhaps it is best to avoid the novel as a medium of expression."</p><p> Dyer's fascination with Lawrence's minorabilia suggests not only an oblique criticism of the contemporary novel, but a promising direction for the memoir. Perhaps clean, well-lighted subjectivity is a dead end, and the future lies with eccentric, provisional works along the lines of <i>Flaubert's Parrot</i> and <i>How Proust Can Change Your Life</i>--or <i>Out of Sheer Rage</i>. After all, Dyer's bright (and brilliantly shambolic) book of life reminds us of why we read in the first place: to see the surprising ways one person can be brought to life by another. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><b>'The funniest book I have ever read' Steve Martin</b></p><h2>Invented Camera Low Tech Photography &amp; Sculpture / Jo Babcock ; Introduction by Bill Berkson ; Essay by Douglas R.

He resides in Washington, D.C., and New York.</p>Cabins have evolved beyond the traditional perceptions of rustic logs, yet the natural setting with the structure both blending in and reflecting the context still remains true today. In the 15 structures illustrated in this book, Trulove highlights cabins with the most modern of conveniences. Built of steel, glass, and recycled materials--though some, if not most, still use wood--these cabins blend into their natural settings, inclusive of vegetation. Although the interiors highlighted are a refuge from the outdoors, the porches, windows, and doors onto the surrounding forests are integrated within. Trulove includes floor plans, elevations, and site plans that will appeal to more do-it-yourself readers. The great variation in size and natural settings of these cabins allows readers to find locations and new concepts and applications of the traditional cabin that will work with their own desires and in their own environs. <i>Vernon Ford</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

What follows is a stunning tour de force in which the eerily idyllic settings of pre-war Europe give way to the exhilarating flight-paths of the frontline aeroplane radio operator, then the prison camps of Germany, the drug-fuelled London of the roaring twenties and, finally, the ancient tombs of Egypt.Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.</p><p>Tom McCarthy is the author of Tintin and the Secret of Literature and three internationally celebrated novels: Remainder, Men in Space and, most recently, C, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

Not of any single person thinking, nor even a group thinking, collectively. It&#x2019;s bigger than that, wider&#x2014;and more direct. It&#x2019;s like the sound of thought itself, its hum and rush. Each night, when Serge drops in on it, it recoils with a wail, then rolls back in crackling waves that carry him away, all rudderless, until his finger, nudging at the dial, can get some traction on it all, some sort of leeway. The first stretches are angry, plaintive, sad&#x2014;and always mute. It&#x2019;s not until, hunched over the potentiometer among fraying cords and soldered wires, his controlled breathing an extension of the frequency of air he&#x2019;s riding on, he gets the first quiet clicks that words start forming: first he jots down the signals as straight graphite lines, long ones and short ones, then, below these, he begins to transcribe curling letters, dim and grainy in the arc light of his desktop . . .<br><br>He&#x2019;s got two masts set up. There&#x2019;s a twenty-two-foot pine one topped with fifteen more feet of bamboo, all bolted to an oak-stump base halfburied in the Mosaic Garden. Tent pegs circle the stump round; steel guy wires, double-insulated, climb from these to tether the mast down. On the chimney of the main house, a pole three feet long reaches the same height as the bamboo. Between the masts are strung four eighteen-gage manganese copper wires threaded through oak-lath crosses. In Serge&#x2019;s bedroom, there&#x2019;s a boxed tuning coil containing twenty feet of silkcovered platinoid, shellacked and scraped. Two dials are mounted on the box&#x2019;s lid: a large, clock-handed one dead in the centre and, to its right, a smaller disc made from ash-wood recessed at the back and dotted at the front by twenty little screws with turned-down heads set in a circle to form switch-studs. The detector&#x2019;s brass with an adjusting knob of ebonite; the condenser&#x2019;s Murdock; the crystal, Chilean gelina quartz, a Mighty Atom mail-ordered from Gamage of Holborn. For the telephone, he tried a normal household one but found it wasn&#x2019;t any use unless he replaced the diaphragms, and moved on to a watch-receiverpattern headset wound to a resistance of eight and a half thousand ohms. The transmitter itself is made of standard brass, a four-inch tapper arm keeping Serge&#x2019;s finger a safe distance from the spark gap. The spark gap flashes blue each time he taps; it makes a spitting noise, so loud he&#x2019;s had to build a silence box around the desk to isolate his little RX station from the sleeping household&#x2014;or, as it becomes more obvious to him with every session, to maintain the little household&#x2019;s fantasy of isolation from the vast sea of transmission roaring all around it.<br><br>Tonight, as on most nights, he starts out local, sweeping from two hundred and fifty to four hundred metres. It&#x2019;s the usual traffic: CQ signals from experimental wireless stations in Masedown and Eliry, tapping out their call signs and then slipping into Q-code once another bug&#x2019;s responded. They exchange signal quality reports, compare equipment, enquire about variations in the weather and degrees of atmospheric interference. The sequence QTC, which Serge, like any other <i>Wireless World </i>subscriber, knows means &#x201c;Have you anything to transmit?&#x201d;, is usually met with a short, negative burst before both questioner and responder move on to fish for other signals. Serge used to answer all CQs, noting each station&#x2019;s details in his call-book; lately, though, he&#x2019;s become more selective in the signals he&#x2019;ll acknowledge, preferring to let the small-fry click away as background chatter, only picking up the pencil to transcribe the dots and dashes when their basic QRNs and QRAs unfold into longer sequences. This is happening right now: an RXer in Lydium who calls himself &#x201c;Wireworm&#x201d; is tapping out his thoughts about the Postmaster General&#x2019;s plans to charge one guinea per station for all amateurs.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . tht bedsteads n gas pipes cn b used as rcving aerials is well-kn0n I mslf hv dn this,&#x201d; Wireworm&#x2019;s boasting, &#x201c;als0 I cn trn pian0 wire in2 tuning coil fashion dtctrs from wshing s0da n a needle mst I obtain lcnses 4 ths wll we gt inspctrs chcking r pots n pans 2 C tht they cnfrm 2 rgulatns I sgst cmpaign cvl ds0bdns agnst such impsitions . . .&#x201d; <br><br>Transcribing his clicks, Serge senses that Wireworm&#x2019;s not so young: no operator under twenty would bother to tap out the whole word &#x201c;fashion.&#x201d; The spacing&#x2019;s a little awkward also: too studied, too self-conscious. Besides, most bugs can improvise equipment: he once made Bodner&#x2019;s spade conduct a signal and the house&#x2019;s pipes vibrate and resonate, sending Frieda running in panic from her bath . . . <br><br>Serge moves up to five hundred metres. Here are stronger, more decisive signals: coastal stations&#x2019; call signs, flung from towering masts. Poldhu&#x2019;s transmitting its weather report; a few nudges away, Malin, Cleethorpes, Nordeich send out theirs. Liverpool&#x2019;s exchanging messages with tugboats in the Mersey: Serge transcribes a rota of towing duties for tomorrow. Further out, the lightship <i>Tongue&#x2019;s</i> reporting a derelict&#x2019;s position: the coordinates click their way in to the Seaforth station, then flash out again, to be acknowledged by Marconi operators of commercial liners, one after the other. The ships&#x2019; names reel off in litany: <i>Falaba, British Sun, Scania, Morea, Carmania</i>, each name appendaged by its church: Cunard Line, Allen, Aberdeen Direct, Canadian Pacific Railway, Holland-America. The clicks peter out, and Serge glances at the clock: it&#x2019;s half a minute before one. A few seconds later, Paris&#x2019;s call-sign comes on: FL for Eiffel. Serge taps his finger on the desktop to the rhythm of the huge tower&#x2019;s stand-by clicks, then holds it still and erect for the silent lull that always comes just before the time-code. All the operators have gone silent: boats, coastal stations, bugs&#x2014;all waiting, like him, for the quarter- second dots to set the air, the world, time itself back in motion as they<br>chime the hour.<br><br>They sound, and then the headphones really come to life. The press digest goes out from Niton, Poldhu, Malin, Cadiz:<i> Diario del Atl�ntico</i>, <i>Journal de l&#x2019;Atlantique</i>, <i>Atlantic Daily News</i> . . . &#x201c;Madero and Su�rez Shot in Mexico While Trying to Escape&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Trade Pact Between&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Entretien de&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Shocking Domestic Tragedy in Bow&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Il Fundatore&#x201d;. . . &#x201c;Husband Unable to Prevent&#x201d; . . . The stories blur together: Serge sees a man clutching a kitchen knife chasing a politician across parched earth, past cacti and armadillos, while ambassadors wave papers around fugitive and pursuer, negotiating terms. &#x201c;Grain Up Five, Lloyds Down Two&#x201d; . . . &#x201c;Australia All Out for Four Hundred and Twenty-one, England Sixty-two for Three in Reply&#x201d; . . .

The operators stay on after the Marconigrams have gone through, chatting to one another: Carrigan&#x2019;s moved to <i>President Lincoln</i>, Borstable to <i>Malwa</i>; the Company Football Team drew two&#x2013;all against the <i>Evening Standard</i> Eleven; old Allsop, wireless instructor at Marconi House, is getting married on the twenty-second . . . <i>His tapper-finger firing up her spark gap</i> . . . <i>Short, then long</i> . . . <i>Olympic</i> and <i>Campania</i> are playing a game of chess: K4 to Q7 . . . K4 to K5 . . . They always start K4 . . . Serge transcribes for a while, then lays his pencil down and lets the sequences run through the space between his ears, sounding his skull: there&#x2019;s a fluency to them, a rhythm that&#x2019;s spontaneous, as though the clicks were somehow speaking on their own and didn&#x2019;t need the detectors, keys or finger-twitching men who cling to them like afterthoughts . . .<br><br>He climbs to six hundred, and picks up ice reports sent out from whalers: floeberg/growler 51n 10' 45.63" lat 36w 12' 39.37 long . . . field ice 59n 42' 43.54" lat 14w 45' 56.25" long . . . Compagnie de T�l�graphie sans Fil reports occasional light snow off Friesland.<br>Paris comes on again; again the cycle pauses and restarts. Then Bergen, Crookhaven, Tarifa, Malaga, Gibraltar. Serge pictures gardenias tucked behind girls&#x2019; ears, red dresses and the blood of bulls. He hears news forwarded, via Port Said and Rome, from Abyssinia, and sees an African girl strumming on some kind of mandolin, jet-black breasts glowing darkly through light silk. Suez is issuing warnings of Somali raiders further down the coast. More names process by: Isle of Perim, Zanzibar, Isle of Socotra, Persian Gulf. Parades of tents line themselves up for him: inside them, dancers serving sherbet; outside, camels saddled with rich carpets, deserts opening up beneath red skies. The air is rich tonight: still and cold, high pressure, the best time of year. He lets a fart slip from his buttocks, and waits for its vapour to reach his nostrils: it, too, carries signals, odour-messages from distant, unseen bowels. When it arrives, he slips the headphones off, opens the silence cabin&#x2019;s door to let some air in and hears a goods train passing half a mile away. The pulsing of its carriage-joins above the steel rails carries to him cleanly.

From former convicts to the highly privileged, they forged their own ways in Van Diemen's land&#x2014;as farmers, traders, publicans, whalers, businessmen, politicians, and more. As they, along with the colony, prospered, they built places of residence and business that stand today as a testament to the quality of Tasmania's early craftsmanship, the wealth of some of its first European residents, and their desire to recreate a piece of home in their new surrounds, no matter how hostile the environment. Tasmania is blessed that so many of these buildings are intact today. Some have been in the same families since the 1820s, others have been saved from ruin or converted into homes after previous lives as anything from hop kilns to coach houses and public schools. All have fascinating stories to tell that reflect the diversity of those early settlers, the adversities they faced, and the opportunities they harnessed, as well as of the characters that inhabit them today. <i>Living in History</i> tells some of these stories through sumptuous photos of Tasmania's most historically and architecturally significant buildings, complemented by text that transports the reader back in time and takes them through to the present, where the current generation of homeowners is literally living in history.</p><p><b>Alice Bennett</b> has established a reputation as an accomplished photographer in a diverse range of disciplines&#x2014;weddings, portraiture, landscapes, aerial photography, and ocean racing.

Headstrong Zenda can't resist sneaking in to look at the balls, and when she handles hers, it shatters into 13 pieces that immediately disappear. A desperate attempt to recover the shards nearly ends in disaster before Zenda comes to understand the consequences of her actions and mysteriously receives the first shard and its magical message. In <i>A New Dimension</i>, Zenda is mysteriously transported to a parallel world where all her problems appear to have been solved. Unfortunately, that's not quite the case, but Zenda learns from her mistakes and is awarded two more shards. The adult characters are stereotypic and the plot is a disconcerting fusion of New Age fantasy and the antics of middle-school girls. It's the intriguing premise and tantalizing hints about Zenda's future that will hook many preteen girls. <i>Chris Sherman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p>Grade 4-6&#x2013;Zenda lives on Azureblue, a planet where each youth receives a gazing ball that reveals his or her lifelong magical skill. She participates in a scheme to peek at hers before the ceremony and it shatters. With sound guidance from her parents and a helpful psychic, she figures out how to start restoring it and finds the first of the 13 crystal fragments. Zenda is a likable yet flawed heroine, tending toward poor decisions and histrionics, but able to accept reasonable consequences. The authors set a brisk pace, keeping the focus on the protagonist and her story. Although this book doesn't have the dense atmosphere of many successful fantasies, it does have a lighthearted quality that affirms the girl's sense of intelligence and responsibility. <i>Zenda</i> is for those who prefer a fantasy with a New Age bent.<i>&#x2013;Pat Leach, Lincoln City Libraries, NE</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Gore-Tex shells and aluminum climbing gear are a century away, but the high mountains still demand your attention. Imagine the stone in your hands and thousands of feet of open air below you, with only a wool jacket to weather a storm and no rope to catch a fall.<br> <br>Daniel Arnold did more than imagine &#x2014; he spent three years retracing the steps of his climbing forefathers, and in <i>Early Days in the Range of Light</i>, he tells their riveting stories. From 1864 to 1931, the Sierra Nevada witnessed some of the most audacious climbing of all time. In the spirit of his predecessors, Arnold carried only rudimentary equipment &#x2014; no ropes, no harness, no specialized climbing shoes. Sometimes he left his backpack and sleeping bag behind as well, and, like John Muir, traveled for days with only a few pounds of food rolled into a sack slung over his shoulder.<br><br>In an artful blend of history, biography, nature, and adventure writing, Arnold brings to life the journeys and the terrain traveled. In the process he uncovers the motivations that drove an extraordinary group of individuals to risk so much for airy summits and close contact with bare stone and snow.</p><p><br> Dan has done something unique in climbing histories he went back in time first, by ferreting out and suffusing himself with ancient lore, then by forgoing modern equipment, and finally by retracing the finger-and-footholds used by the first climbers. His approach, as wackily original as the colorful characters he introduces, worked.

He has also written several movie and TV tie-ins and a number of young adult novels under the name Joseph Locke. In 2006, he received the Grand Master of Horror Award. He lives in northern California with his wife.</p>A serial rapist is on the loose in the sleepy California town of Big Rock, and sheriff Farrell Hurley's secretary is the latest victim. When a self-proclaimed werewolf hunter named Daniel Fargo comes into town claiming that Big Rock has an infestation of the creatures, Hurley thinks the man is insane, until the eviscerated corpses and attacks by large animals start in earnest. For Garton, lycanthropy is an STD, spread mostly through rape, that runs rampant through a small town fraught with affairs and intrigues. His werewolf is a terrifying creature: not a remorseful, helpless cursed human but a homicidal beast driven by a dual urge to breed and feed. Hurley is a sheriff to root for, and Garton's well-paced horror novel reworks the werewolf myth to great effect. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But that's quickly over. Far more shocking is the eerie quietude: the power failure that eliminates the humming of air-conditioning and refrigerators, the absence of music, the traffic that has come to a standstill. It's as if a mute button has been pushed on the world. That's what it's like when a television series ends. The lights go out, the people scatter, the magic has died. And the Cybill show did not go gently. I did not go gently.</p><p>Over a thirty-year career, I had died before - cacophonous, public, psychically bloody deaths engineered at the box office and at the hands of critics-but this demise was singularly painful. I'd given my name and much of my identity to the series, blurring the line between real life and fiction, much more than is customary in television. (Murphy Brown was not called Candice, and the character didn't grow up with a wooden dummy for a brother.) Every door on our CBS soundstage had a plaque with CYBILL inscribed inside a blue chalk star, just like the one used under the opening title that pans across the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Gunsmoke was produced on that stage for eighteen years, but there was no trace of that iconic piece of American television history in the wings. As I drove off the lot for the last time, I knew how quickly my presence would evaporate, how soon the studio maintenance department would remove those plaques and the billboard-size CYBILL on the side of the stage.</p><p>The eulogies were not kind. While the real reasons for the show's demise were never made public, I was accused of professional paranoia and megalomania, of being, as Lady Caroline Lamb famously said of Lord Byron, "mad, bad and dangerous to know." I was labeled a jealous egomaniac, a self-promoting bitch, and a few other well-chosen words whose invocation would have gotten my mouth washed out with Camay in my Memphis childhood. I preserved all the poison-pen notices as a record, hard evidence of what I had survived and the proof that I wasn't paranoid. I had clearly made people exceedingly angry, committed some unpardonable transgression. It was not the first time.</p><p>What got me in trouble, what has always gotten me in trouble, was disobedience. On the Cybill show, I had been 57 different kinds of disobedient. From the beginning, my strategy was to challenge-always with humor-the conventional wisdom about "appropriate" subjects for television audiences. I was the first baby boomer to have a prime-time hot flash, and we skewered the injustice of a culture that pretends women over forty are invisible. I persuaded the writers to incorporate ideas from my own odyssey of discovery, like cultivating a reverence for three symbolic stages of a woman's life: maiden, mother, and crone. (Okay, okay, there's a brief cheerleader phase in there that can't be ignored.) I had the temerity to become a grandmother on American television, one experience not replicated in real life, but when my character cooed to her TV daughter, "And you even got married first!" it was a mocking reference to my own pregnancies before marriage. When my character's two ex-husbands happened to be in the living room just as her date showed up on the doorstep, art was mirroring my life, as it was in an episode about male impotence (delicately referred to on the show as "failing to perform").</p><p>Strange to think that these themes were considered radical by network executives and reviewers, but women who represent the cultural gamut of sizes' and ages aren't too welcome in any media. After nearly a decade of murmuring "I'm worth it" for L'Oreal, I was fired because my hair got too old -approximately as old as I was. It's okay for Robert Mitchum to get up early in the morning and look like Robert Mitchum, but it was not okay for me to wake up in the morning and look like Robert Mitchum. Fans are always asking why Bruce Willis and I don't reprise our Moonlighting roles for the big screen. The answer is: studio executives would consider me too old for him now.</p><p>With few exceptions, American television has become the Bermuda Triangle for females over forty. There was a wide variety of middle-aged women on the air in 1998, and they were all gone by 1999. Not only Cybill, but Murphy Brown, Ellen, Roseanne, Grace Under Fire, and Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman all disappeared the same year. It's true that these shows had been around for a while and may have run their course, so this chorus of swan songs takes on a deeper significance when we see the replacements: Felicity, Dharma &amp; Greg, Moesha, Ally McBeal, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and those very skinny Friends. No one over thirty need apply.</p><p>But I had defied convention beyond my approach...</p></p><h2>Experiences in Translation (Toronto Italian Studies / Emilio Goggio Publications Series)</h2><p><p>In this book Umberto Eco argues that translation is not about comparing two languages, but about the interpretation of a text in two different languages, thus involving a shift between cultures. An author whose works have appeared in many languages, Eco is also the translator of G�rard de Nerval's Sylvie and Raymond <em>Queneau's Exercices de style</em> from French into Italian. In <em>Experiences in Translation</em> he draws on his substantial practical experience to identify and discuss some central problems of translation. As he convincingly demonstrates, a translation can express an evident deep sense of a text even when violating both lexical and referential faithfulness. Depicting translation as a semiotic task, he uses a wide range of source materials as illustration: the translations of his own and other novels, translations of the dialogue of American films into Italian, and various versions of the Bible. In the second part of his study he deals with translation theories proposed by Jakobson, Steiner, Peirce, and others.</p><p>Overall, Eco identifies the different types of interpretive acts that count as translation. An enticing new typology emerges, based on his insistence on a common-sense approach and the necessity of taking a critical stance.</p></p><p><p>'Eco remarks at the outset that he doesn't offer a theoretical approach to translation, but a common sense approach ... Then he gives us enough theory to satisfy the most demanding readers.'-Floyd Merrell, Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures, Purdue University</p><p>'Theory is given concrete exemplification, the likes of which one would rarely expect to find in a book on translation 'theory''</p></p><h2>Prelude (The American Anthem Series #1)</h2><p><p>B.J.

Susanna wished she could believe that the sun rising over the sprawling American city heralded the dawn of an exciting future, a new life with new opportunities. But as the harbor came into view, any hopes she might have held for tomorrow threatened to sink. A flood of doubts rolled over her, vast and unfathomable as the ocean itself.<p></p> Susanna pulled her wrap tighter, watching as the ship slowly eased its way toward the pier. Floating garbage and debris littered the water, and she covered her nose and mouth against the stench. At the same time, a small barge angled up alongside them, and she could see an assembly of people thronging the smaller vessel, some waving at the passengers on the deck of the Spain.<p></p> &#x201c;Why, look there, Mother&#x2014;I believe some of our friends have come to meet us!&#x201d; <p></p> Susanna recognized Mr. Moody&#x2019;s voice and turned to find him and Mrs. Moody, along with their children and the Sankeys, grouped just behind her. Nearby stood Dr. Carmichael, who had traveled to the States with the Moodys as a part of their en-<br>tourage. Apparently, the Scottish physician had played some role or other in the British Isles crusades, although Susanna had never quite determined exactly what that role was. <p></p> &#x201c;Ah, Miss Fallon, here we are at last!&#x201d; boomed Mr. Moody. &#x201c;How does it feel to be in America?&#x201d; <p></p> The burly, bearded D. L. Moody and his wife were beaming at her, and Susanna attempted a smile in return. &#x201c;In truth, Mr. Moody, the only thing I&#x2019;m feeling at the moment is panic.&#x201d;<p></p> It struck Susanna that the American evangelist looked nearly as tired as he had when she&#x2019;d first encountered him upon leaving Liverpool. And small wonder, given the fact that even aboard ship he had been continually attending to the needs of others. <p></p> His wife, who seemed to draw from a limitless supply of kindness, patted Susanna on the arm with a gloved hand. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be just fine, dear,&#x201d; she murmured. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going to love America, you know. This is a splendid opportunity for you.&#x201d;<p></p> &#x201c;Of course, it is!&#x201d; Mr. Moody added, his tone enthusiastic. &#x201c;Now, you did say there will be someone to meet you?&#x201d; <p></p> Susanna nodded uncertainly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I was told, yes.&#x201d; <p></p> Mrs. Moody surprised her by pulling her into a quick embrace. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re so very glad we met you, Susanna. We&#x2019;ll be praying that everything goes well for you, dear. You&#x2019;re very brave, to come so far on behalf of your niece and brother-in-law. I know the Lord will look afer you.&#x201d;<p></p> To her dismay, Susanna felt hot tears sting her eyes. Her chance meeting with the Moodys and the Sankeys had done much to ease her dread of the ocean voyage. Upon learning that she was a young Christian woman traveling alone, both couples had gone out of their way to look after her, inviting her to sit with them at mealtimes, answering her endless questions about the United States, and engaging her in frequent discussions about her own country of Ireland, as well as their common interest in music.<p></p> Even before the crossing, Susanna had learned a great deal about Mr. Moody and his &#x201c;campaigns,&#x201d; as he referred to them. It seemed that the whole of the British Isles had been taken by surprise at the success of the Moody/Sankey meetings, not only in England and Scotland, but also in the heavily Protestant north of Ireland&#x2014;and in the mostly Catholic south as well.<p></p> Susanna had been only one of thousands who had flocked to the early crusades. She could scarcely believe her good fortune a few months later when she found herself aboard the same ship as the American evangelists, who were returning to the States. To have the privilege of spending time with these esteemed spiritual leaders and their families had not only made the voyage less harrowing for her, but had actually given her a number of pleasurable hours. <p></p> Only now did the finality of their parting strike her. She was going to miss them greatly. <p></p> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to thank you,&#x201d; she choked out, &#x201c;all of you&#x2014;for your kindness to me. I can&#x2019;t think what the crossing would have been like without you.&#x201d; <p></p> &#x201c;Well, dear, it was awfully good of your brother-in-law to arrange first-class passage for you,&#x201d; said Mrs. Moody. &#x201c;Other-<br>wise, we might not have encountered one another at all. And how fortunate for you, to be spared the ordeal of traveling in steerage.&#x201d;<p></p> At the thought of the brother-in-law she had never met, Susanna tensed. Mrs. Moody, however, seemed not to notice. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we&#x2019;ll see each other again, Susanna. There are plans for Mr. Moody to hold meetings in New York this fall.&#x201d; <p></p> &#x201c;And if that works out,&#x201d; Mr. Moody put in, &#x201c;we&#x2019;ll expect to see you in the very front row. Until then, you take special care, Miss Fallon, and just remember that your friends the Moodys and the Sankeys will be praying for you.&#x201d; <p></p> He paused, then drew a strong, encompassing arm around his wife and motioned that the Sankeys and Dr. Carmichael should move in closer. &#x201c;In fact, we would like to pray for you right now, before we leave the ship.&#x201d;<p></p> And so they did, standing there on deck. Susanna had heard Mr. Moody pray before, of course: at their table before meals, at a shipboard worship service, and during the revival meetings she and her friend, Anna Kearns, had attended at the Exhi-<br>bition Palace in Dublin. It seemed that when D. L. Moody prayed, he spoke directly with God, whom he obviously knew very well and approached boldly and eagerly, with an almost unheard-of confidence. <p></p> But to have this amazing man praying solely for her was an overwhelming experience entirely. By the final Amen, much of the strain that had been weighing on her for weeks seemed to melt away.<p></p> Once they disembarked and the Moodys and Sankeys had joined their welcoming party, Susanna&#x2019;s earlier apprehension returned in force. <p></p> The harbor was a different world. She found herself unable to move more than a few feet in any direction because of the throngs of people milling about. The noise was almost deafening&#x2014;a harsh, unintelligible din of a dozen different languages, all flooding the docks at once. The shouts and laughter of sailors and passengers, the cries of greeting and wails of farewell, the pounding of feet on the planks as children ran and shoved their way among the grownups, the occasional blast from a ship&#x2019;s horn&#x2014;all converged and hammered against Susanna&#x2019;s ears until she thought her head would split. <p></p> She stood there in the midst of this bedlam, not quite knowing what to do, fighting off a rising surge of panic. In that moment, she realized with a stark new clarity how utterly alone she was.<p></p> A man&#x2019;s voice sounded behind her. &#x201c;Signorina Fallon?&#x201d;<p></p> Startled, she whipped around as if she&#x2019;d been struck, ready to defend herself. <p></p> &#x201c;You are Susanna Fallon?&#x201d; he said. <p></p> He was young, with a fairly long, pleasant face and lively eyes behind his spectacles. And he was smiling at her, a wide, good-natured smile. He was also holding a bouquet of flowers and appeared not in the least threatening. <p></p> Susanna stared at him. The dark features, the Italian accent&#x2014;it could be no one else.<p></p> But so young! According to Deirdre, Michael Emmanuel ought to be in his mid to late thirties by now. Yet he had called her by name. <p></p> &#x201c;Mr. Emmanuel?&#x201d; she ventured. <p></p> He gave his head a vigorous shake. &#x201c;No, no! I am not Michael. I am Paul Santi, Michael&#x2019;s cousin. I have come to take you home.&#x201d;<p></p> &#x201c;Home?&#x201d;<p></p> He nodded. &#x201c;S�.&#x201d; <p></p> Whether it was fatigue or anxiety, Susanna&#x2019;s mind seemed to have gone suddenly dull. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t&#x2014;how did you recognize me? How did you find me?&#x201d;<p></p> &#x201c;Your hat,&#x201d; he said, gesturing toward Susanna&#x2019;s bonnet. &#x201c;Did you not write that you would be wearing a hat with blue ribbons?&#x201d; His smile brightened even more.&#x201c;These are for you,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;with Michael&#x2019;s compliments.&#x201d; <p></p> He thrust the lavish bouquet into Susanna&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;If you will come with me, signorina, we must first go there, to the depot.&#x201d; He pointed to a granite, fortresslike circular building. &#x201c;Castle Garden,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;I will help you with the registration and the paperwork. Michael has already made arrangements for you to be passed through quickly. Do not worry about your luggage&#x2014;I will take care of it. I have been through this myself, you see. I know exactly what to do.&#x201d; <p></p> Susanna glanced across the dock and saw the tall, kindly featured Dr. Carmichael standing there, watching them. For an instant, she was seized by an irrational desire to run toward the man, to flee the solicitude of this dark-eyed foreigner for the pleasant-natured physician and his link to the Moodys. <p></p> But she hardly knew Dr. Carmichael any better than she knew this Paul Santi. She must be mad entirely to think of throwing herself at the mercy of a man who was known to her only by his association with the Moodys&#x2014;themselves strangers until a few days past. <p></p>Regaining her wits, she turned back to Paul Santi and, bearing her bouquet and a hard-won sense of determination, managed a careful smile and a civil word as he led her across the docks.</p><h2>Big Bad Wolf (The Others, Book 2)</h2><p><p>Missy Roper's fantasies have revolved around Graham Winters since the moment they met.

In Red Lights, Tiantian Zheng highlights the urban karaoke bar as the locus at which these three factors intersect and provides a rich account of the lives of karaoke hostessesOCoa career whose name disguises the sex work and minimizes the surprising influence these women often have as power brokers. Zheng embarked on two years of intensely embedded ethnographic fieldwork in her birthplace, Dalian, a large northeastern Chinese seaport of over six million people. During this time, Zheng lived and worked with a group of hostesses in a karaoke bar, facing many of the same dangers that they did and forming strong, intimate bonds with them. The result is an especially engaging, moving story of young, rural women struggling to find meaning, develop a modern and autonomous identity, and, ultimately, survive within an oppressively patriarchal state system. Moving from her case studies to broader theories of sex, gender, and power, Zheng connects a growth in capitalist entrepreneurialism to the emergence of an urban sex industry, brilliantly illuminating the ways in which hostesses, their clients, and the state are mutually created in postsocialist China. &#34;</p><p>Tiantian Zheng is associate professor of anthropology at the State University of New York, Cortland.</p><h2>Dolphin Danger (Secret Mermaid)</h2><p>Dive into this magical mermaid series from bestselling author Sue Mongredien, featuring gorgeously girly illustrations.

Marshall</strong> trained with RELATE, the UK's leading couple-counselling charity and leads a team of therapists offering the Marshall Method in London, England. He is the author of the international best seller<i> I Love You But I'm Not In Love with You </i>and sixteen other titles on relationships. His work has been translated into twenty different languages.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p> <p>Almost one in five couples who come to my marital counseling office are dealing with the fallout from an affair. In fact, it is the fourth most common reason for seeking my help. According to Kinsey's groundbreaking research in forties and fifties America, 26 percent of married women and 50 percent of married men had cheated on their spouses; while the British Sexual Fantasy Research Project found that 55 percent of the adult population has committed adultery at some point. Subsequent research has produced similar findings. When you throw in all the couples who have been living together or dating, the numbers are even greater. At times, it feels like a tidal wave of misery, betrayal, and hurt is flooding my therapy office.</p> <p>However, it is not all bad news. Infidelity might be a terrible crisis but the Chinese symbol for crisis is made up of two words: danger and opportunity. If you have bought this book after discovering your partner's adultery, or because your own adultery has been discovered and your relationship is hanging in the balance, you will be only too aware of the danger. My aim is to open your eyes to the opportunity. Infidelity turns life upside down and makes you question everything. The fear that it could all happen again shines a spotlight on all the murky corners of your relationship and provides the impetus to change. Sometimes clients moan: 'I just want my old life back.' That's not possible, but if you seize on the opportunity part of crisis, you can find a deeper, more durable, and ultimately better relationship.</p> <p>I have tried to keep the tone of this book compassionate. (There are exceptions, but few people set out to have an affair.) It is mainly aimed at the Discoverers of adultery&#x2015;because they are generally the most hurt and most in need of answers&#x2015;but each chapter has a box addressed specifically to the Discovered. My hope is that couples will share the book and find that the exercises provide them with a bridge to understanding each other better. If you are the third party in the affair triangle, you will find less of a direct benefit. However, I hope this book will provide an insight into the dynamics of adultery and, if your affair has ended, to help in the healing process.</p> <p>In writing <i>How Can I Ever Trust You Again?</i>, I have drawn on clients from over thirty years of marital therapy as well as interviews with people not in counseling and questionnaires filled in by visitors to my website. (This research was publicized in articles about infidelity in several leading UK newspapers and by the <i>Huffington Post</i>&#x2015;the Internet newspaper. In total, fifteen hundred questionnaires were submitted from all over the world. Sixty-eight percent were completed by people who had discovered their partner's infidelity, 32 percent by those who had been unfaithful&#x2015;and of these just over half had confessed to their partner about the affair.) To protect confidentiality, I have blended sometimes two or three cases together. My thanks, as always, to everyone who has shared their experiences. I hope it helped make sense of what happened and provided the building blocks for a brighter future.</p> <p>How to use this book:</p> <ul> <li>The main part of each chapter is written for someone who has discovered their partner's infidelity.</li> <li>At the end of each chapter, there is a box for people who have been unfaithful. This is followed by a section about the particular lesson from this stage in the journey and a summary of the whole chapter.</li> <li>It is better if both you and your partner read the whole book.</li></ul> <p>However, I have designed the program so that it will work if your partner only reads his or her section.</p> <ul> <li>Don't worry if your partner distrusts self-help books, or is uncertain about the future; this program will help you cope better, think before acting, and become more balanced. This, in turn, will have a positive knock-on effect on your partner's behavior and enable the two of you to cooperate better.</li> <li>Read the whole program, so that you have a sense of the overall journey, and then concentrate on your particular stage.</li> <li>When you are in crisis, depressed, or under stress, turn back to the previous chapter. It could be that you have missed some important piece of healing and need to return and complete that stage.</li> <li>Take a deep breath. Keep calm. Things will get better.</li></ul> <p>�2016 Andrew G. Marshall. All rights reserved. Reprinted from <i>How Can I Ever Trust You Again? Infidelity: From Discovery to Recovery in Seven Steps</i>.

Morgan's three gifted storytellers tell it like it was--with a vengeance.</p></p><p>First order of business for the pioneers was finding their way. After that came marking, then clearing, and finally paving that way. Axing wilderness inroads inch-by-inch, linking settlement with settlement - this was the challenge. The Hinterlands is the story of a family who found, marked, and paved their way into America&#39;s eastern frontier. Unfolding in the voices of three generations of mountaineer storytellers who specialize in keeping listeners on the edge of their seats, this is fiction that plunks us down right into the thick of pioneer life. In 1772, an adventurous teenager named Petal ran off with a handsome homesteader on his way to the new frontier in Tennessee. Decades later, Petal spins a hair-raising tale for her grandchildren. She includes all the grittiest details of setting up housekeeping with what she carried from home on her back, of birthing her first baby while staving off a panther, of living in the middle of nowhere - with nary a known neighbor. In 1816, Petal&#39;s grandson Solomon and a starved pig named Sue tracked the best route down off the mountain to market. He tells his grandson of his panther, not forgetting to mention his run-ins with snakes and spiders, with thorny thickets and what was hidden within them. In 1845, Solomon&#39;s son David, inheritor of the family bent for roadbuilding, took on linking two mountains with a turnpike. Despite one mountain&#39;s mighty efforts to stop him, his feat marked the beginning of the wilderness&#39;s end. Based on the author&#39;s own family stories, The Hinterlands is both rollicking folk history and riveting adventure fiction. Robert Morgan&#39;s three gifted storytellers tell it like it was - and with a vengeance!Robert Morgan is the bestselling author of numerous works of fiction&#x2014;including the Oprah Book Club selection Gap Creek&#x2014;and non-fiction, and is also an established poet with fourteen collections to his credit.

Not that fairy godmothers are normally high on the list of things I expect to see, even as weird as my life is. I work for a magical company, so running into fairies, gnomes, elves, wizards, and talking gargoyles is something that happens every day. But I&#x2019;d never yet seen an honest-to-goodness fairy godmother, and I really wasn&#x2019;t expecting to see one that morning because, for the first time in my life, I really didn&#x2019;t need one.<br><br>As of the night before, I had my Prince Charming. At the company Christmas party, Owen Palmer, the wonderfully handsome, brilliant, powerful wizard who also happened to be an incredibly nice guy, had kissed me like he meant it and told me he&#x2019;d always had an interest in me. Yeah, the guy who was the magical world&#x2019;s answer to a movie star liked plain old nonmagical Katie Chandler, the ordinary small-town girl from Texas. That Saturday morning was our first official date as two people who&#x2019;d admitted that we had feelings for each other. We were meeting for brunch at a snug little coffee shop on Irving Place, possibly the most romantic New York setting I could imagine for a casual first date.<br><br>Which meant, of course, that the fairy godmother had to be waiting for someone else. At least, I assumed she was a fairy godmother. I know making assumptions can be dangerous, but I was pretty good about seeing the truth, and she looked like Central Casting&#x2019;s idea of a fairy godmother. She looked older than the eternally youthful fairies I knew, and her wings were a fairly good sign that she wasn&#x2019;t just another eccentric New Yorker. A star-topped wand lying on the table in front of her was yet another clue. None of the other magical folk I knew used wands. Anyone else would surely have made the same assumption, if they saw what I saw.<br><br>I almost felt sorry for whomever her Cinderella was because she didn&#x2019;t exactly look like the top-of-the-line fairy godmother. Unlike most of the fairies I knew, she was squat and round, but I couldn&#x2019;t tell if that was flesh or if it was her clothes. She looked like instead of taking off the previous day&#x2019;s clothes and putting on something new each morning, she just put on a new outfit on top of the old one&#x2014;and she&#x2019;d been doing that for centuries. In all the layers of clothing I caught glimpses of calico, tulle, patchwork, satin, and velvet. The top layer was old, dusty rose velvet, worn threadbare in places. A rusty tiara missing a few stones sat haphazardly on top of her gray sausage curls, and one of her fairy wings was bent.<br><br>Of course, no one in the coffee shop seemed to notice that there was anyone odd among them, and it wasn&#x2019;t simply because they were all distracted by their newspapers and conversations or because the caffeine hadn&#x2019;t yet made it to their brains. I&#x2019;m immune to magic, so the spell she used to hide her magical appearance didn&#x2019;t work on me. I saw what was really there, while I was sure the rest of the patrons probably saw only an elderly woman wearing a tweed suit and sensible shoes.<br><br>But as I said, it wasn&#x2019;t any of my business. I was about five minutes early because I knew Owen was relentlessly punctual and I was sadly overeager, but I figured I could use the time to stake out a table. Unfortunately, the shop was crowded, and there weren&#x2019;t that many tables to begin with. I lingered near the doorway, waiting either for Owen to show up or for someone to vacate a table.<br><br>&#x201c;Yoo hoo! Katie!&#x201d; I turned when I heard my name and saw the fairy godmother waving at me. I waved back halfheartedly, and she pointed her wand at the empty seat across from her. With a shrug, I went over and took the seat. There was always a chance I could talk her into leaving, and then I would have managed to snag a table before Owen got there. &#x201c;Oh good, you&#x2019;re right on time,&#x201d; she said as I sat down.<br><br>&#x201c;On time for what?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Our meeting, of course.&#x201d; She gave a tinkling little laugh. &#x201c;But silly me, I haven&#x2019;t introduced myself. I&#x2019;m Ethelinda, your fairy godmother. I&#x2019;ll be managing your case, helping you find true love.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There must have been some kind of mix-up then. I don&#x2019;t need any help right now. You would have really come in handy for the past ten years, but now things are finally working out for me.&#x201d;<br><br>She waved her star-topped wand over the table and an elaborately decorated china tea set appeared. As she poured two cups and dropped in lumps of sugar, she said, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t make mistakes. You probably need more help than you think, and that&#x2019;s why I was sent your way. Milk or lemon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Milk, please. But I&#x2019;m actually meeting someone for a date here in a minute or two. So, you see, I don&#x2019;t need help right now, for probably the first time in my life. I&#x2019;ve found Prince Charming, he&#x2019;s found me, and all&#x2019;s right with the world.&#x201d;<br><br>Frowning, she waved her wand again, and a battered, dog-eared book appeared on the table. She took the pair of spectacles that hung on a cord around her neck and brought them up to rest on her nose. One of the earpieces was missing, so they hung lopsided on her face. &#x201c;Hmmm,&#x201d; she murmured as she flipped through the book. &#x201c;Oh, yes, I see what you mean. I haven&#x2019;t seen such a sad case in a very long time. You really could have used a helping hand or two, couldn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>I cringed at her description of what I assumed was my dating history. A lot of other people&#x2019;s dating histories would also have had to be in that book, though, for it to be that fat. My relationship history wouldn&#x2019;t have required much more than an index card. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s putting it mildly. So you can see why I&#x2019;m confused. If you weren&#x2019;t around all those years when almost every man I met acted like I was his little sister or thought I was too boring and nice, then I don&#x2019;t see why you&#x2019;re here now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t waste time with the little things. We only step in when destiny is at stake, when it matters in the grand scheme of the universe whether or not you find your fated true love.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fated true love&#x201d; sounded like something out of the worst kind of romance novels. It also sounded like something out of my wildest fantasies. Fate sure would make finding Mr. Right and knowing he was Mr. Right a lot easier. If Owen and I really were meant to be together, then I could relax about whether or not a super-powerful wizard could stay interested in someone like me. Then a doubt struck me. &#x201c;Um, we are talking about Owen Palmer here, aren&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; It would have been just my luck if she&#x2019;d shown up at this particular time to hook me up with someone entirely different.<br><br>She consulted her book again, flipping through pages and making little humming noises to herself as she did so. At last she said, &#x201c;Most definitely. And, my, he seems to have needed even more help than you did with his past romances. He&#x2019;s awfully shy, isn&#x2019;t he? But then, we only work for women. The men are on their own.&#x201d; She gave a tittering laugh. &#x201c;After all, you don&#x2019;t hear much about Prince Charming getting any help from a fairy godmother, only Cinderella.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, but isn&#x2019;t Cinderella a&#x2014;&#x201d; I almost said &#x201c;a fairy tale,&#x201d; but then wondered if that might be considered offensive. &#x201c;&#x2014;fiction?&#x201d;<br><br>She raised one eyebrow above the frame of her glasses, giving her face an even more lopsided appearance as the glasses dangled precariously off one side of her nose. &#x201c;Then how would you explain the fact that almost every human culture has some variation of the classic Cinderella story?&#x201d; She sniffed disdainfully. &#x201c;That was one of my biggest triumphs. I even won an award.&#x201d; She fished around her neckline until she hooked a finger on a golden chain, then pulled on the chain to raise a star-shaped medal from somewhere deep within the layers of clothes. &#x201c;See? My claim to fame.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very nice,&#x201d; I said, even though the medal was so tarnished it may have been an award for best apple pie at the county fair, for all I could tell. I tried to remember all the fairy tales I&#x2019;d read and heard&#x2014;beyond the Disney versions. &#x201c;But aren&#x2019;t there also a lot of stories about fairies helping out good-hearted younger sons on quests?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Those are fairies, not fairy godmothers,&#x201d; she said with an exasperated sigh, like she got that question a lot. &#x201c;There is a significant difference, you know. We have our own kind of magic, very specific powers and all that. Now, about your case.&#x201d;<br><br>I heard the door open and turned to look, hoping it wouldn&#x2019;t be Owen, not yet. Fortunately, it wasn&#x2019;t. He&#x2019;d picked a very good time to break his punctuality habit. The last thing I wanted was for him to catch me consulting a fairy godmother. It would give him the totally wrong impression. I turned back to Ethelinda. &#x201c;Not that I don&#x2019;t appreciate the offer, but I really don&#x2019;t think I need help right now. I&#x2019;d like to try to work things out on my own.&#x201d;<br><br>Her glasses fell off her face, bouncing once on their cord against her ample chest. She looked positively heartbroken. &#x201c;Whatever you think is best,&#x201d; she said, her tone chilly, but with enough breaks in her voice to make it clear that she&#x2019;d put on the ice as a way of covering her hurt.<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t stand to make an old woman&#x2014;fairy godmother or otherwise&#x2014;cry. &#x201c;I suppose if it starts to be a total disaster, then maybe I could give you a call.&#x201d;<br><br>She brightened immediately. Her book disappeared, and a golden heart-shaped locket appeared in her left hand. &#x201c;You can contact me through this,&#x201d; she said, handing it to me across the table. &#x201c;Open it when you need me. You&#x2019;ll know what to do from there.&#x201d; And then before I could ask any questions, she was gone, vanished into thin air, along with her tea set.<br><br>As I dropped the locket into my jacket pocket, I felt a gust of cold air and thought for a second that it was an aftereffect of her vanishing spell, but then I realized the door had opened. I looked up and saw Owen entering the coffee shop. I wasn&#x2019;t the only one gazing at him. He looked like a celebrity heartthrob, he was so ridiculously handsome. I could practically hear the other patrons trying to remember what movie they&#x2019;d seen him in as he spotted me and hurried across the room to fall into the seat Ethelinda had just vacated.<br><br>On this particular morning, he looked like something out of a paparazzi photo of a celebrity in his off-hours. His nearly black hair was still slightly damp, as if from a shower, and it curled up a little around his ears and at the back of his neck. There was a faint shadow on his strong jaw, and his dark blue eyes were hidden behind wire-rimmed glasses.<br><br>I might have been put out that he hadn&#x2019;t made at least some effort on our first official date if he hadn&#x2019;t appeared so flustered. &#x201c;Sorry I&#x2019;m late,&#x201d; he said, slightly out of breath. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s been a bit of a crisis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; I asked, immediately concerned.<br><br>A paper cup bearing the shop&#x2019;s logo appeared between his hands, and he picked it up and took a long sip. I noticed then that a similar cup had appeared in front of me, so I got a little caffeine into my system while I waited for him to answer. Cups appearing out of nowhere were practically normal in my life, especially around Owen, so I&#x2019;d long since gotten used to it.<br><br>&#x201c;Ari got away last night,&#x201d; he said at last, sounding like he&#x2019;d finally caught his breath and settled down some. Ari was the wicked fairy&#x2014;and my ex-friend&#x2014;who&#x2019;d been helping our company&#x2019;s enemy by spying and sabotaging from within Magic, Spells, and Illusions, Inc., the company where both Owen and I worked. We&#x2019;d exposed her at the company party the night before, and she&#x2019;d been taken into custody by the company security forces.<br><br>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d she escape?&#x201d; I asked.</p><h2>The Herb Gardener: A Guide for All Seasons</h2><p><p>Whether you keep a few potted herbs on an apartment windowsill or tend a large outdoor garden, this easy-to-use guide is filled with proven techniques that will help you keep your plants thriving.

This sure-fire plot, destined to woo readers, offers the welcome message of tolerance. The crisp text and autumn-muted paintings are a triumph of energy, enthusiasm, and design. Excellent to share with older readers, thought-provoking at any age."--(starred) <i>Booklist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><p><b>Sam Swope</b> lives in New York City and teaches creative writing in schools across the country and on the Internet. </p><p><b>Barry Root</b> is the illustrator of many books for children. He lives in Quarryville, Pennsylvania.</p>Grade 2-5-- When the colorful, noisy, multihued Araboolies move to conventional, quiet Liberty Street, General Pinch and his wife are horrified. And when the Araboolies paint their house in bright zigzags, camp on the front lawn, and engage the neighborhood children in wild and joyful games, General Pinch calls out the army. Quickly the children decorate every house with paints, banners and balloons, leaving the General's house as the "weird one" on the block. Following orders to find the house that is different, the soldiers tie up the Pinch's house and drag it away. Brightly colored, sweeping, full double-page paintings enliven this modern fable of people vs. government. Swope's message may well be that diversity and individuality are good, but what comes through in the story is the sense that modern neighborhoods, no matter how ordinary, exist under the threat of military enforcement. The fact that the children of the neighborhood are able to cover up the radical individualism of the dissident family and turn the tables on the General himself gives no comfort. The pictures are full of action and entertainment, and the book can prove useful--not for the lighthearted story that was probably intended, but for consideration of the seldom-discussed role of the military in modern societies. The creators of this book, perhaps unwittingly, have produced that rarity, a picture book that deals with political issues as well as more subtle social themes of tolerance, conformity, and the rights of the individual in a community. --Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I Love You, Grandma</h2><p>Little Bear is getting older, and that means he is ready for new adventures.

Twenty-five years after the last U.S. troops left Vietnam, the most divisive U.S. armed conflict since the War of 1812 remains an open wound not only because 58,000 Americans were killed and billions of dollars wasted, but also because it was an ignominious, unprecedented defeat. In this iconoclastic new study, Vietnam veteran and scholar Jeffrey Record looks past the consensual myths of responsibility to offer the most trenchant, balanced, and compelling analysis ever published of the causes for America's first defeat.</p><br><p>Sure to spark widespread discussion and argument among veterans, academics, policy-makers, military professionals, and interested citizens, this landmark contribution breaks new ground by candidly examining the strategic failures of the military's leadership--long portrayed as innocent victims--and exploring whether a different policy could have avoided defeat. With a rare blend of relevant personal experience and impeccable scholarship, Record establishes four root causes for the U.S. defeat in a logical, easy-to-follow argument that explodes earlier professional assessments and popular appraisals. Vietnam-noble cause, international crime, or strategic mistake? Record's surprising and sometimes incendiary answers to these and other questions critical to the future success of the civilian-run military will ensure that the armed forces' accountability in Vietnam is no longer overlooked.</p></p><p>For all the countless books the Vietnam War has inspired--the anguished analysis, revised history, and blow-by-blow reports--no consensus has even been reached on precisely who, or what, is to blame for America's failure in Southeast Asia. The antiwar movement, the media, Lyndon Johnson, Robert McNamara, Congress, and staunch military hawks have all been implicated in the defeat, but a commonly accepted explanation (or scapegoat) remains elusive. <p> Jeffrey Record may not provide the final, binding word on Vietnam, but in <i>The Wrong War</i>, he is prepared to place blame squarely on the shoulders of both the military and civilian leadership for their lack of communication and inability to establish a clear objective. As a former civilian State Department adviser in Vietnam and legislative assistant to Senators Sam Nunn and Lloyd Bentsen, Record was close to the action in Asia and Washington, and he believes the U.S. set itself up for failure largely by overestimating the military's ability to break the Viet Cong and underestimating the Vietnamese will to fight; lessons that should have been learned by watching the French limp out of Indochina several years before. The Americans, he stresses, were on a blinding anti-Communism crusade, while there was much more at stake for the Vietnamese than political ideology, particularly nationalistic fervor and an insatiable desire to rid themselves of colonialism. Though his book is a fiercely critical analysis, Record attempts to draw important lessons from what he calls the "most strategically reckless American enterprise of the 20th century."</p>Jeffrey Record is a professor of strategy at the Air War College in Montgomery, Alabama. He served in Vietnam as a civilian pacification adviser and received his doctorate from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He lives in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><h2>Isle of Winds (The Changeling Series)</h2><p>Enter the Netherworlde... Become the Changeling. 'An exciting story, fast-moving with surprises and mysteries galore' &#x2013; Simon Clark Robin Fellows lives with his grandmother and lives what appears to be a rather ordinary life for a normal twelve year old boy. But when Robin&#x2019;s Gran dies, quite suddenly and a bit mysteriously, his world is turned upside down. A long lost relative comes out of the woodwork and whisks him away to a mysterious new home, Erlking Hall, a quiet estate in the solitary countryside of Lancashire. Suddenly Robin must adjust to his new reality. But reality is no longer what he thought it was... Erlking has many secrets &#x2013; as do his newly found Great-Aunt Irene and her servants. After a strange encounter on the train and meeting a cold, eerie man on the platform, Robin begins to notice odd happenings at Erlking. There is more than meets the eye to this old, rambling mansion. Little does he know that there is more than meets the eye to himself. Robin is the world&#x2019;s last Changeling. He is descended from a mystic race of Fae-people, whose homeland, the Netherworlde, is caught in the throes of a terrible civil war. Not only this, but in this new world there is a magical force that has infiltrated the human realm. Before he can wrench power from the malevolent hands of the Netherworlde&#x2019;s fearsome tyrant leader, Lady Eris, he must first search for the truth about himself and the ethereal Towers of Arcania. The first instalment of The Changeling Series, Isle of Winds is an engrossing tale written in the traditions of high fantasy story-telling while carving out a magical new realm. It is perfect for fans of The Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series. James lives in the North of England, close to wild moors and adjacent to a haunted wind farm, with his extremely patient and long-suffering family and a very old cat named Gargoyle. When the cat dies, James plans to buy a raven and name it Quoth. He is the author of the Changeling fantasy series, following the adventures of Robin, a seemingly unremarkable boy who is swept up into a war between our world, and the Netherworlde, a shadowy realm which lies beyond our own. In addition to fantasy, James also writes Science Fiction, Urban Gothic and Steampunk, for people old enough to know better.

The witch and her cat fly happily over forests, rivers and mountains on their broomstick until a stormy wind blows away the witch&#39;s hat, bow and wand. They are retrieved by a dog, a bird and a frog, and each animal asks for a ride on the broom. They climb on, one after the next, until the broom is so heavy that it snaps in two! What will happen next as they tumble into a bog and meet a greedy dragon? Room on the Broom is a very funny story of quick wits and friendship and will captivate children with Julia Donaldson&#39;s irresistible verse and Axel Scheffler&#39;s spectacular illustrations.</p><p>There's always room for one more on this affable witch's broomstick... or is there? In another mild-mannered tale from the creators of the Smarties Prize-winning picture book, <i>The Gruffalo</i>, a witch and her happily purring cat fly through the wind on their broomstick, without a care in the world, until the witch's black hat blows away. In the process of retrieving it, they pick up another passenger, a polite and helpful dog. All goes well until the witch's hair bow flies off. And then her wand. And then real disaster strikes--in the shape of a big red dragon, a broken broom, and some very important (but notably absent) friends. Julia Donaldson's story, though not earthshaking in plot or rhyme, is a pleasant way to pass the time leading up to the witching hour (Halloween!) especially when paired with the friendly illustrations by Axel Scheffler. Readers will especially love the final illustration, in which our heroes solve their space problems once and for all.

Scully employs a reductive vocabulary of thick horizontal and vertical bands of color, which perform an interplay of mass, light and shadow, through which he reconciles the ordered character of early European Modernism, with its ideals of harmony and spirituality, and late American Modernism, with its use of less harmonious, expressionistic compositions. Scully has described this tension: "I'm trying to capture something that has a classical stillness and at the same time has enough emotion or dissonance to create an unresolved quality." This volume, published concurrently with an exhibition at New York's Galerie Lelong, features 22 recent paintings, including works from Scully's much-admired <i>Wall of Light</i> and <i>Robe</i> series, plus recent watercolors and drawings.</p><p><b>David Carrier</b> is Champney Family Professor, Case Western University and the Cleveland Institute of Art.Text: Italian, English</p><h2>The Tin Roof Blowdown: A Dave Robicheaux Novel</h2><p>This is James Lee Burke&#39;s latest mystery featuring Dave Robicheaux. It is also much more than that. The story begins with the shooting of two would-be looters in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, and then follows a motley group of characters - from street thugs to a big-time mob boss, from a junkie priest to a sadistic psychopath - as their stories converge on a cache of stolen diamonds, while the storm turns the Big Easy into a lawless wasteland of apocalyptic proportions. The nightmarish landscape created by Katrina seems the perfect setting for Burke&#39;s almost Biblical visions of good and evil - it is as if he had to wait for this disaster to find the occasion to match his emotionally supercharged prose. You can feel the undercurrents of rage and pain beneath the narrative, making this not only his most personal and deeply felt book for some time, but quite possibly his best novel to date. This is not just a superb crime novel, it is potentially THE fictional chronicle of a disaster whose human dimensions America is still struggling to process.</p><p><b>James Lee Burke</b>, a rare winner of two Edgar Awards, and named Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America,&nbsp;is the author of&nbsp;twenty-six previous novels and&nbsp;two collections of short stories, including such <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers as <i>Swan Peak</i>, <i>Tin Roof Blowdown</i>, <i>Last Car to Elysian Fields</i> and <i>Crusader's Cross</i>.&nbsp; He lives in Missoula, Montana, and New Iberia, Louisiana.<br><br><b>Will Patton</b>'s numerous film credits include<i> Remember the Titans</i>, <i>The Punisher</i>, <i>The Mothman Prophesies</i>, <i>Armageddon</i>, and <i>The Spitfire Grill</i>.

The dreams are in color but they contain no sound, not of drowned voices in the river or the explosions under the hooches in the village we burned or the thropping of the Jolly Green and the gunships coming low and flat across the canopy, like insects pasted against a molten sun. </p><p> In the dream I lie on a poncho liner, dehydrated with blood expander, my upper thigh and side torn by wounds that could have been put there by wolves. I am convinced I will die unless I receive plasma back at battalion aid. Next to me lies a Negro corporal, wearing only his trousers and boots, his skin coal-black, his torso split open like a gaping red zipper from his armpit down to his groin, the damage to his body so grievous, traumatic, and terrible to see or touch he doesn't understand what has happened to him. </p><p> "I got the spins, Loot. How I look?" he says. </p><p> "We've got the million-dollar ticket, Doo-doo. We're Freedom Bird bound," I reply. </p><p> His face is crisscrossed with sweat, his mouth as glossy and bright as freshly applied lipstick when he tries to smile. </p><p> The Jolly Green loads up and lifts off, with Doo-doo and twelve other wounded on board. I stare upward at its strange rectangular shape, its blades whirling against a lavender sky, and secretly I resent the fact that I and others are left behind to wait on the slick and the chance that serious numbers of NVA are coming through the grass. Then I witness the most bizarre and cruel and seemingly unfair event of my entire life. </p><p> As the Jolly Green climbs above the river and turns toward the China Sea, a solitary RPG streaks at a forty-five-degree angle from the canopy below and explodes inside the bay. The ship shudders once and cracks in half, its fuel tanks blooming into an enormous orange fireball. The wounded on board are coated with flame as they plummet downward toward the water. </p><p> Their lives are taken incrementally - by flying shrapnel and bullets, by liquid flame on their skin, and by drowning in a river. In effect, they are forced to die three times. A medieval torturer could not have devised a more diabolic fate. </p><p> When I wake from the dream, I have to sit for a long time on the side of the bed, my arms clenched across my chest, as though I've caught a chill or the malarial mosquito is once again having its way with my metabolism. I assure myself that the dream is only a dream, that if it were real I would have heard sounds and not simply seen images that are the stuff of history now and are not considered of interest by those who are determined to re-create them. </p><p> I also tell myself that the past is a decaying memory and that I do not have to relive and empower it unless I choose to do so. As a recovering drunk, I know I cannot allow myself the luxury of resenting my government for lying to a whole generation of young men and women who believed they were serving a noble cause. Nor can I resent those who treated us as oddities if not pariahs when we returned home. </p><p> When I go back to sleep, I once again tell myself I will never again have to witness the wide-scale suffering of innocent civilians, nor the betrayal and abandonment of our countrymen when they need us most. </p><p> But that was before Katrina. That was before a storm with greater impact than the bomb blast that struck Hiroshima peeled the face off southern Louisiana. That was before one of the most beautiful cities in the Western Hemisphere was killed three times, and not just by the forces of nature. </p><p> Copyright � 2007 by James Lee Burke</p></p><h2>The Great Scottish Witch-Hunt</h2><p>Scotland, in common with the rest of Europe, was troubled from time to time by outbreaks of witchcraft which the authorities sought to contain and then to suppress, and the outbreak of 1658-1662 is generally agreed to represent the high water mark of Scottish persecution. These were peculiar years for Scotland. For nine years Scotland was effectively an English province with largely English officials in charge. In 1660 this suddenly changed, so the threat to church and state from a plague of witches was particularly disturbing. The tension between imported official English attitudes to witchcraft and the revived fervor of Calvinist religion combined to produce a peculiar atmosphere in which the activities of witches drew hostile attention to an unprecedented degree.</p><p><p><b>P.

He has since illustrated well over 100 titles, mainly for children and young adults, including around 60 in the bestselling &#39;You Wouldn&#39;t Want to Be&#39; series.Grade 4-6-At first glance, these profusely illustrated books appear to be a lighthearted approach to some grim chapters in the history of the world. Chapter titles are often blithe and the cartoon art depicts the gory and abominable treatment of one group of people by another. But closer examination of the texts and pictures reveals informative books, packed full of the facts students often seek. The first title describes the life of a woman from the Black Sea area who is kidnapped and taken to serve as a slave in ancient Greece. The treatment of the slaves by the aristocracy is depicted along with descriptions of everyday life. Gladiator highlights the superiority of the Roman army, which returned its prisoners to Rome where they were trained to be arena fighters. Rules of battle and types of gladiators are described. Mention is also made of the simulated sea battles that took place in the flooded arenas and of staged wild-animal hunts. Mummy covers the process of embalming and mummification along with the symbolic features of an Egyptian burial. Discoveries of tombs and modern beliefs about mummies are also included. While these books cover material included in other titles, their approach to history will be extremely popular with students who relish a bit of blood and guts along with their historical facts.<br><i>Elizabeth Stumpf, Clearfield Middle School, PA </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Sexton Blake casebook</h2><p>1st edition hardcover, vg++ book in vg+ dw, nice copy</p><p></p><h2>The Grit in the Pearl: The Scandalous Life of Margaret, Duchess of Argyll</h2><p>Margaret, Duchess of Argyll (1912-1993) was an international celebrity in her youth, adored and observed by millions. But in 1963, the year of the Profumo Affair, the 11th Duke of Argyll shocked the country when he alleged that his adulterous wife had slept with over eighty men behind his back.

And as he confesses, peeling back the layers of his strange story, we are led to question what we know about truth and memory, brain and mind, personality and fate, about one another and ourselves. Written with psychological depth and great lyrical precision, this suspenseful and groundbreaking novel delivers a voice for our times&#x2014;funny, probing, skeptical, mischievous, profound. <i>Andrew&#x2019;s Brain</i> is a surprising turn and a singular achievement in the canon of a writer whose prose has the power to create its own landscape, and whose great topic, in the words of Don DeLillo, is &#x201c;the reach of American possibility, in which plain lives take on the cadences of history.&#x201d;<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Andrew&#x2019;s Brain</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Too compelling to put down . . . fascinating, sometimes funny, often profound . . .

It is the first time the Yosemite Decimal system was applied to Butchart s routes. When Harvey Butchart arrived in Flagstaff, Arizona from Iowa just after the end of World War II, he had only seen pictures of the Grand Canyon in books. Soon, he made his first trip there and was hooked. For 40 years, the mathematics professor from NAU, later called the undisputed king of extreme and obsessive Grand Canyon hiking by Backpacker Magazine, hiked more than 12,000 miles into remote and previously uncharted Canyon territory recording his routes on detailed maps and in journal entries. From Lee's Ferry to Lake Mead, Harvey Butchart was credited with finding more than 116 new approaches to the Colorado River and with summiting 83 of the 138 named peaks in the Canyon, 35 of those being first ascents. In <b>Grand Canyon Treks</b>, Butchart shares his pioneering explorations with entirely new generations of Grand Canyon adventurers.</p><p>Only a few thousand people visited the Grand Canyon each year when Harvey Butchart first started hiking there. Many of those early visitors rarely ventured below the Rim unless it was in the guarded safety of a guided mule train. Over the years, their numbers have grown dramatically, with nearly five million people a year now visiting the South Rim alone. Of those, approximately 60,000 make it into the Grand Canyon�s backcountry � more than 1.2 million acres of wild and rugged terrain, where traditional trails are virtually non-existent, and are replaced by cross-country routes through serpentine chasms carved out of rock hundreds of millions of years old. The closest thing resembling a trail might be an old, winding prospector�s track which hasn�t seen a man-made improvement in almost a century. <p> Many of Harvey Butchart�s routes drop down cracks in steep ravines and traverse narrow ledges with nothing more than meager finger-holds with which to balance one�s weight. They follow faint game trails, tight twisting side canyons and boulder clogged, vertical-walled creek beds. There are dead-ends at dry waterfalls and false starts at a canyon�s edge. In many cases, back-tracking is required. Water is very scarce; and, at least three quarts to four gallons, depending on the route and trip duration, should be carried if springs are unreliable or unknown. </p><p> Nature, powerful and unsettled, is constantly changing the appearance of these routes. Over the years, floods and fluctuating water flows on the Colorado River have changed the landscape along the river itself. Beaches are created and swept away. Debris flows may fill the mouth of a canyon with boulders and rocks standing twelve feet high, only to be washed away by a flash flood a few months later. Rockslides have wiped away portions of old foot trails or blocked them with slabs of fallen rock.</p><p> Experienced canyon hikers or mountaineers who have hiked in rugged desert terrain will understand what it takes to plan and commit to a trip in the remote backcountry of the Grand Canyon. The ability to read a 7.5 minute topographic map and to use a compass for navigation; experience in route finding; good physical conditioning and endurance; carrying the right equipment; competent climbing ability; comfort on exposed rock and the ability to decipher vague routes through the constantly changing shape of the land are just some of the skills needed for this kind of travel. Hiking with companions, experience and skill can make the difference between life and death. Long hard days, heavy loads of water, and challenging, rugged terrain � these are the primary characteristics of Harvey Butchart�s routes.</p><p> In the autumn of 1945, as the aspen trees turned gold on the Colorado Plateau and the Second World War came to an end, Harvey Butchart took what was to be the first of hundreds of hikes in the Grand Canyon. During the next forty years, he would walk over 12,000 miles, log more than 1,000 actual hiking days and record his experiences in a notebook. He developed a keen eye for being able to identify routes through uncertain terrain and hiked to places in the Grand Canyon that no contemporary had previously visited or has been to since, according to many. Even today, Harvey Butchart continues to influence generations of canyon hikers who follow in his footsteps. There is no question � the mathematics professor from the heartland is the father of contemporary Grand Canyon hiking.</p><p> Nearly four thousand years ago, prehistoric people who were the descendants of the Paleoindians, the oldest known cultural tradition in native North America, made the first impression on the Grand Canyon. Subtle reminders of these ancient people and those that followed them are hidden within the vast, endless miles of inner gorge, vertical cliffs and blue-green water � a hand print on the overhang of a cliff, a split-twig figurine in the dark recesses of a cave, or steps cut into a vertical wall of rock.</p><p> John Wesley Powell�s exploration of the Colorado River in 1869 was responsible for initiating a flurry of activity in the Grand Canyon throughout the second half of the 19th century, and well into the 20th. Men and women attempted to turn dreams into personal fortune or fame often at the Canyon�s expense, and many met with disillusionment or tragedy. Prospectors, developers, railroad men and every possible kind of promoter wandered through the Canyon with the thought of turning its immense natural beauty into personal fortunes and glory. Tourists and hikers eventually discovered the Grand Canyon, and many of these later visitors, unlike their predecessors, came solely for the experience of enjoying its awesome natural beauty and solitude.</p><p> During the years of the Great Depression, exploration of the Grand Canyon backcountry was sporadic at best, with attention still focused on the water � the Colorado River. It wasn�t until the end of World War II, that a new age of backcountry discovery and exploration prevailed. </p><p> Harvey Butchart and his wife, Roma, with their two children, moved from Iowa to Flagstaff with the expectation that the drier climate of the Arizona desert might cure his daughter�s asthma. Harvey had accepted a position as a mathematics professor at Arizona State College at Flagstaff, which would later become Northern Arizona University. Not long after arriving in Flagstaff, he made his first trip to the Grand Canyon.</p><p> For the next forty years, Harvey would spend nearly every day off, weekend and holiday driving from Flagstaff to the Grand Canyon. Until he was 70, he hiked in the Grand Canyon throughout the year, though there were times when, despite the fact that he seemed to tolerate heat better than most, he was so weakened by it that he had to sit down for awhile beneath whatever shade he could find. In later years, most of his Canyon hiking was done during the cooler temperatures of winter. His knowledge of elusive springs was so thorough, that he rarely carried more than two gallons of water as a buffer between them. With the exception of water, lightweight was the way he preferred to travel. He didn�t carry a tent, preferring to sleep on an air mattress beneath the starry skies. He ate sandwiches of white bread and margarine, snacks of peanuts and prunes. The heaviest object in his pack was a flannel-lined Dacron sleeping bag, the kind used for car-camping. He eventually upgraded to a lightweight down bag. When it did rain, he covered himself with a plastic tarp and slept safe and dry on his air mattress while the water puddled around it. At night, while lying in his sleeping bag, he listened to the mice scamper across the pots and pans.</p><p> Harvey Butchart climbed 83 of the 138 or so named Grand Canyon summits. Twenty-five of those were first ascents. Credited with finding some 116 approaches to the Colorado River, he kept detailed trail notes and marked his routes on a set of Matthes-Evans Grand Canyon maps, the only complete map of the area available at that time (significant updates have been made on more recent maps). Of all the trails he hiked, the engineering of the Kaibab impressed him the most as did the beauty of the North Rim Trail. Nankoweap Mesa provided his most solitary wilderness experience. Scattered pot sherds and the absence of man-made cairns suggested that he may have been the first to walk the mesa since the ancients. His favorite personal achievement was being able to locate Royal Arch Creek, which wasn�t on the old Matthes-Evans map. He had great physical endurance and speed, and could complete in one day, what would take most people two or three. <i>-- Wynne Benti, Publisher</i></p>This may be the place to say something about my role in Grand Canyon lore. When our daughter developed hay fever in Iowa, I welcomed the opportunity to teach mathematics at Northern Arizona University in the dry desert climate. At first, the Canyon was just another place to hike along with the Rockies and the San Francisco peaks in the Flagstaff area. However, the challenge of discovering new routes through the cliffs became an obsession, and finding ruins, waterfalls and natural bridges became the lure. I felt like I was part of a chain that dated back to prehistoric Indians and Spanish explorers. I read all the books about the Canyon that I could find, while �Dock� Marston and Plez �P.T.� Reilly gave me suggestions for doing the legwork for their chronicles. By 1963, Colin Fletcher referred to me as the one who really knew the Canyon and had kept a journal of what was to be enjoyed there. John Annerino called me the �father of modern Grand Canyon hiking.� The park rangers were always appreciative since I gave the research library a copy of my hiking logs and large maps showing where I had been. I only wish that my predecessors � Hance, Bass and the Kolbs had left such records, and I certainly regret that my immediate mentor, Merrel Clubb, hadn�t documented his trips.<p> Walt Wheelock was the initial inspiration for my effort to get something in print about my Grand Canyon wanderings, and Wynne Benti proposed to give it new form and a new lease on life. I was glad to accept Wheelock�s offer to publish what I had learned, as it was my hope that what I had learned would not die with me. Still, my book is intentionally sketchy so the reader might have to do a little guessing about the details.</p><p> I dedicate this book to all who enjoy the Grand Canyon, and to those who may use this book to enhance their own Canyon experience.<b> --Harvey Butchart</b></p></p><h2>Louvre: 400 Masterpieces</h2><p>Since first opening its doors in 1793, the Louvre has become one of the largest and most famous museums in the world and, with 8.3 million visitors per year, it is also the most visited. <i>Louvre: 400 Masterpieces</i> showcases a selection of works from this great institution, from the most famous&#x2015;the<i> Venus de Milo</i> and <i>Mona Lisa</i>&#x2015;to lesser-known gems. <p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>With a foreword by the institution&#x2019;s director, Henri Loyrette, the book is organized according to the museum&#x2019;s eight departments: Near Eastern Antiquities; Egyptian Antiquities; Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Antiquities; Islamic Art; Sculptures; Decorative Arts; Paintings; and Prints and Drawings.

Son of an African Methodist Episcopal minister, Henry Tanner (1859-1937) trained under Thomas Eakins in Philadelphia, then left his native U.S. in 1891 for Paris; a proud, quiet individualist determined to surmount racism, he would spent most of his life in France, serving as a beacon to the Harlem Renaissance. Tanner's sensitive, naturalistic animal studies, modernized reinterpretations of biblical themes, subdued yet powerful WW I scenes and brooding, mystical oriental pictures had an impact that was "by no means race-bound"; his continual experimentation with techniques likewise influenced many artists. Tanner's marvelous visionary paintings of the late 1920s and early '30s are full of foreboding of a world on the brink of self-destruction. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.Scion of a distinguished African American family, Tanner achieved international fame as a painter of genre and religious scenes in the first decades of this century only to lapse into obscurity in self-imposed exile in France. His resurrection and reappraisal, begun in the 1960s, will be greatly aided by this well-illustrated and scholarly catalog of the current nationally traveling retrospective. By virtue of its integration of biography and art criticism with 105 color and 94 black-and-white illustrations, this book is the preeminent work on Tanner.

It must assume that the reader is already a competent photographer capable of taking successful and perhaps creatively original photographs of general outdoor subjects. In this book are discussed in outline many aspects of technique, ideas, and interpretation, as well as the use of studios, lighting, props, locations, and choice of equipment. Models are all important - so quite a bit of space is devoted to the problems of finding them and directing them. But most important of all, the book contains a lot of fine photographs, examples of the many techniques and interpretations discussed. Study them. Look for the subtleties that make what could so easily have been an ordinary photograph into a work of art. Seek out the less than obvious uses of photographic technique; try to assess why the composition, the lighting, or the textural quality imparts an emotive character to the image. Understanding how others stir your emotions is the best possible beginning to learning how to create emotive photographs yourself. So enjoy the images in this book; let their sensuality or abstract appeal be a source of inspiration and guidance. Then see if you can do better.</p><p></p><h2>His Mysterious Ways: More Than Coincidence</h2><p>&#34;God&#39;s ways may be mysterious but His presence and purposes are not&#34;.

Cyan Dag, knight of Gloinmere, is sworn to serve King Regis Aurum of Yves. Cyan's oath leads him headlong into dangerous magical territory, however, when Idra, Bard of Skye, reveals that the King's new bride, Lady Gwynne, is an impostor. The true Lady Gwynne is trapped in an enchanted stone tower in distant Skye, a magical mirror her only means of viewing the outside world. Bound by his oath to protect the King, Cyan rides west to free Lady Gwynne. In the meantime, Thayne Ysse, son of the king of Ysse, has never forgotten his father's defeat at the hands of King Regis Aurum. Now he seeks a tower guarded by a dragon, a tower filled with gold enough to raise a new army and defeat Yves once and for all. And in another ancient tower outside the coastal village of Stony Wood, Melanthos, the daughter of a land-bound selkie and a fisherman, obsessively embroiders pictures of a lonely woman trapped in a distant tower who may or may not be real. Although Cyan Dag took up his quest with one goal in mind, he soon realizes that the only route to saving Lady Gwynne lies tangled with the lives of Thayne and Melanthos, and in the mysterious motives of Idra and her woods-wise sister Sidera.

In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious.<br><br>The novel opens with these simple, resonant words: "Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge." They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a- novel. Entitled <i>The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.<br><br>Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and clich�s of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience. The novel has many threads and a series of events that follow one another at a breathtaking pace. As everything comes together, readers will discover that the story Atwood is telling is not only what it seems to be--but, in fact, much more.<br><br>The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time. Like The Handmaid's Tale, it is destined to become a classic. <br></i></p><p><i>The Blind Assassin</i> is a tale of two sisters, one of whom dies under ambiguous circumstances in the opening pages. The survivor, Iris Chase Griffen, initially seems a little cold-blooded about this death in the family. But as Margaret Atwood's most ambitious work unfolds--a tricky process, in fact, with several nested narratives and even an entire novel-within-a-novel--we're reminded of just how complicated the familial game of hide-and-seek can be: <blockquote> What had she been thinking of as the car sailed off the bridge, then hung suspended in the afternoon sunlight, glinting like a dragonfly, for that one instant of held breath before the plummet? Of Alex, of Richard, of bad faith, of our father and his wreckage; of God, perhaps, and her fatal, triangular bargain. </blockquote> Meanwhile, Atwood immediately launches into an excerpt from Laura Chase's novel, <i>The Blind Assassin</i>, posthumously published in 1947. In this double-decker concoction, a wealthy woman dabbles in blue-collar passion, even as her lover regales her with a series of science-fictional parables. Complicated? You bet. But the author puts all this variegation to good use, taking expert measure of our capacity for self-delusion and complicity, not to mention desolation. Almost everybody in her sprawling narrative manages to--or prefers to--overlook what's in plain sight. And memory isn't much of a salve either, as Iris points out: "Nothing is more difficult than to understand the dead, I've found; but nothing is more dangerous than to ignore them." Yet Atwood never succumbs to postmodern cynicism, or modish contempt for her characters. On the contrary, she's capable of great tenderness, and as we immerse ourselves in Iris's spliced-in memoir, it's clear that this buttoned-up socialite has been anything but blind to the chaos surrounding her. <i>--Darya Silver</i>"The first great novel of the new millennium."<br>--<i>Newsday<br></i><br>"Absorbing... expertly rendered...

He left school at the age of 14 to work on sailing barges and spent the rest of his life at sea-in the Royal Navy, as a delivery skipper, and as a daring seagoing adventurer traveling the world in search of new and ever greater challenges.In 1983 Tristan Jones had his left leg amputated. After a long and arduous lifetime at sea, it would have been understandable if he had made his way far inland carrying a pair of oars over his shoulder, until someone asked: What are those things you re carrying?' And there he would settle down.<br><br>But not him. Instead, he acquired a 38 ft (11.6 m) trimaran and set out to sail around the world. This book is the third episode of an extraordinary saga. The first, Outward Leg, told of his voyage from San Diego to London; the second, The Improbable Voyage, of his journey from the North Sea, through the rivers of Central Europe, to the Black Sea; and in this final installment he sails 8,000 miles from Istanbul to Thailand.<br><br>The trip is hardly what one might call pleasant. Along the way, he and his two young crew battle with life-threatening encounters with terrorists, warring nations, tropical cyclones and the vast, windless expanse of the Indian Ocean, where he and his crew fight to survive on a dwindling ration of water. Jones meets all these problems head-on with his usual mix of stubborn resourcefulness and acerbic wit. Not one to suffer fools gladly, our Tristan. A gritty, compelling read from a man who refused to accept society's restraints and who has become something of a national maritime treasure. (<i>Classic Boat</i>)</p><h2>The Forgotten Soldier</h2><p><i>Forgotten Soldier</i>&nbsp;recounts the horror of World War II on the eastern front, as seen through the eyes of a teenaged German soldier. At first an exciting adventure, young Guy Sajer&#x2019;s war becomes, as the German invasion falters in the icy vastness of the Ukraine, a simple, desperate struggle for survival against cold, hunger, and above all the terrifying Soviet artillery. As a member of the elite Gross Deutschland Division, he fought in all the great battles from Kursk to Kharkov.<br><br> Sajer's German footsoldier&#x2019;s perspective makes <i>The Forgotten Soldier</i> a unique war memoir, the book that the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> said "may well be the book about World War II which has been so long awaited." Now it has been handsomely republished containing fifty rare German combat photos of life and death at the eastern front. The photos of troops battling through snow, mud, burned villages, and rubble-strewn cities depict the hardships and destructiveness of war. Many are originally from the private collections of German soldiers and have never been published before.

It is intended as an introductory guide or handbook to the early rabbinic parables - parables either explicitly attributed to rabbis of the first two centuries of the Common Era or else from literature reporting traditions almost exclusively from that period.<br>The first half of the work provides 125 parables selected from the authors' collection of well over a thousand rabbinic parables. With each parable is an indication of the approximate date of the alleged author and, when noted, other versions of the parable in rabbinic literature. The second half of the study is a series of preliminary essays on various aspects of the form and content of these parables. The concluding three essays deal particularly with the relation between rabbinic parables and those found in the Gospels.</p><p></p><h2>Six Screen Plays by Robert Riskin</h2><p>Screenwriter Robert Riskin (1897-1955) was a towering figure even among the giants of Hollywood's Golden Age. Known for his unique blend of humor and romance, wisecracking and idealism, Riskin teamed with director Frank Capra to produce some of his most memorable films. Pat McGilligan has collected six of the best Riskin scripts: <i>Platinum Blonde</i> (1931), <i>American Madness</i> (1932), <i>It Happened One Night</i> (1934), <i>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</i> (1936), <i>Lost Horizon</i> (1937), and <i>Meet John Doe</i> (1941). All of them were directed by Capra, and although Capra's work has been amply chronicled and celebrated, Riskin's share in the collaboration has been overlooked since his death. McGilligan provides the "backstory" for the forgotten half of the team, indispensable counterpoint to the director's self-mythologizing autobiography&#x2014;and incidentally the missing link in any study of Capra's career.<br><br>Riskin's own career, although interrupted by patriotic duty and cut short by personal tragedy, produced as consistent, entertaining, thoughtful, and enduring a body of work as any Hollywood writer's. Those who know and love these vintage films will treasure these scripts. McGilligan's introduction offers new information and insights for fans, scholars, and general readers.</p><p>When we hear the titles <i>It Happened One Night</i>, <i>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</i>, <i>Lost Horizon</i>, and <i>Meet John Doe</i>, we think immediately of Frank Capra, their brilliant and much beloved director. But did you know that these and many other Capra films were all written by the same man, the unfairly neglected Robert Riskin? Such films, like all of Capra's best, are wonderfully witty, a delightful marriage of word and image. With <i>Six Screenplays by Robert Riskin</i>, you can read about the lesser-known element of the Capra/Riskin collaboration and treat yourself to six of the best screenplays ever written. Patrick McGilligan has provided good notes to the scripts as well as a fine introduction that describes Riskin's Lower East Side upbringing in New York City, his early career in movies, his collaboration and friendship with Capra, his marriage to Fay Wray, and his sad, untimely death.<b>Robert Riskin</b>, who arrived in Hollywood in 1930, was one of the industry's greatest screenwriters. He won an Academy Award for the screenplay of <i>It Happened One Night</i> and Oscar nominations for <i>Lady for a Day, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, You Can't Take It with You</i>, and <i>Here Comes the Groom</i> (story only). The Writers Guild honored him with its Laurel Award for Lifetime Achievement. <b>Pat McGilligan</b>, a resident of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has written acclaimed biographies of James Cagney, Robert Altman, George Cukor, Jack Nicholson, and a new biography of director Fritz Lang called <i>Fritz Lang: The Nature of the Beast</i>. His <i>Backstory</i> series for the University of California Press, like the Nicholson biography, has been translated into several foreign languages.</p><h2>Lonely Planet Slovenia (Country Guide)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p><b><i>Lonely Planet Slovenia</i></b> is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

He is of Italian descent. Having obtained a degree in acting from the Goodman School of Drama and taken to the stage early on in life, it is no surprise that Joe has maintained a strong relationship with the playwright-turned-screenwriter-director&nbsp;David Mamet. They have collaborated on several projects. He also stars as SSA David Rossi on the long running TV drama Criminal Minds.

Then he scribbled in the margins and underlined important passages, while slashing others. For each section he planned to film, he included notes on synopsis, texture, tone, and pitfalls to avoid.

Though the schools&#x2019; autumn term was well under way, plenty of tourists unencumbered by children still came to Cornwall. After yesterday&#x2019;s drizzle, today they were being rewarded with a day as bright and warm as summer. Even the usual cool sea breeze had stilled.<br>On the other side of the narrow street, a couple were coming out of the bakery, which stayed open at lunchtime till the end of September. The man carried a brown paper bag with twisted corners. He opened it and sniffed, whereupon the woman took it from him and firmly rolled the top. Hot pasties, Eleanor guessed. The couple turned down the hill, no doubt making for one of the benches overlooking the harbour.<br>&#x201c;<i>Wuff,</i>&#x201d; Teazle reminded her.<br>She transferred the piece of sausage to the dog bowl. As she straightened after putting the bowl on the floor, the phone rang. A few steps took her across the sitting room to her desk by the window at the back of the cottage. She picked up the receiver and gave her number.<br>&#x201c;Aunt Nell, it&#x2019;s Megan. It&#x2019;s such a gorgeous day, if you&#x2019;re taking Teazle for a walk, I&#x2019;d like to join you. I didn&#x2019;t get to bed till three&#x2014;we just wrapped up a big burglary case&#x2014;and if I don&#x2019;t get out, I&#x2019;ll doze all afternoon and not sleep tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, dear. Shall I drive over to Launceston and pick you up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s all right. You won&#x2019;t believe this, but the DI has not only given me the afternoon off, he&#x2019;s said I can take a CaRaDoC car&#x2014;plain, not a panda&#x2014;in case he has to call me back unexpectedly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. Scumble?&#x201d; Eleanor, though in general inclined to believe the best of people, had clashed more than once with the detective inspector and mistrusted his apparent benevolence. &#x201c;Are you sure you didn&#x2019;t misunderstand him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure. He said I looked peaky.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That sounds more like him, managing to combine an insult with a favour. Are you not feeling well, dear?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, just a bit tired. We&#x2019;ve been working long hours for a couple of weeks. I&#x2019;ll be over in about an hour, if that&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you meet us at Rocky Valley? Nick wants to do some sketching and photographing there, and I promised to take him this afternoon. It&#x2019;s a lovely place to walk.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nick Gresham? I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly, Megan. It&#x2019;s months since he was arrested and he doesn&#x2019;t hold it against you. He&#x2019;s my next-door neighbour, you can&#x2019;t avoid him forever.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve managed pretty well so far! It&#x2019;s very embarrassing when you&#x2019;ve had to question someone about his&nbsp;... personal life. Oh, all right, I&#x2019;ll be there. It&#x2019;s between Tintagel and Boscastle, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, dear. There&#x2019;s a lay-by on the east side of the coast road. Or it might be the south side at that point, come to think of it. Never mind&#x2014;It&#x2019;s just on a sharp bend, and there&#x2019;s a footpath sign on the sea side. We&#x2019;ll see you in an hour or so.&#x201d;<br>Eleanor was glad Megan had agreed to come but disappointed by her reluctance. She was very fond of Nick and her niece. They were both about thirty, the perfect age for settling down, and both free of romantic entanglements. What could be more natural than that they should become fond of each other? Unfortunately, the artist and the detective sergeant rarely saw eye to eye. Eleanor sighed.<br>Teazle, having heard the magic word &#x201c;walk,&#x201d; was waiting impatiently by the door. Now she cocked her head, whining. Eleanor heard footsteps running up the stairs, followed by a knock.<br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; she called.<br>The door opened. &#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; said Nick as Teazle&#x2019;s back paws danced on her bare, sandalled feet. &#x201c;Down, girl.&#x201d; She rolled over on her back and he crouched to pet her tummy, his long brown ponytail flopping over his shoulder. The sleeves of his blue shirt were rolled up above the elbow. The shirt was spotless, but a splotch of turquoise paint on his arm had eluded him. &#x201c;Ready to go, Eleanor? Shall I go and get the Incorruptible?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, dear, would you?&#x201d; Eleanor&#x2019;s pea-green Morris Minor (named after Robespierre, the &#x201c;sea-green Incorruptible&#x201d;) lived at the bottom of the hill, in a shed she rented on the only flat piece of ground in Port Mabyn. The one and only street was too narrow for parking. &#x201c;The keys are on the hook&#x2014;oh, no, they&#x2019;re not. In my handbag? No, they must be in a pocket. What was I wearing last time I took the car out?&#x201d;<br>Nick grinned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but it hasn&#x2019;t been this warm and dry for a couple of weeks, so try your coat pockets.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you taking a mac? The sun may be shining now, but it is September, after all, and you never can tell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My anorak&#x2019;s in my satchel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Here are the keys. But there&#x2019;s no hurry. Megan&#x2019;s going to meet us there in about an hour.&#x201d;<br>He raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;Detective Sergeant Pencarrow intends to grace us with her presence? I was under the impression that I&#x2019;m out of favour. You did tell her I&#x2019;ll be there, didn&#x2019;t you, Eleanor?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course. It&#x2019;s not that she dislikes you, Nick.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She just disapproves.&#x201d; He laughed. &#x201c;Well, I like your niece, but not enough to be shorn like a copper. As for keeping my clothes and my person paint-free, it&#x2019;s just not possible. If it&#x2019;s all right with you, I&#x2019;d like to get going. I want to reach the inlet while the sun&#x2019;s still high. You could let me out and go begging in Bossiney or Boscastle till it&#x2019;s time to meet Megan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Requesting donations for LonStar is not begging,&#x201d; Eleanor said severely. The London Committee to Save the Starving had employed her for decades as a roving ambassador, travelling all over the world. After retiring to Cornwall, she had dedicated her ground floor to a charity shop and now spent much of her time travelling the countryside, picking up donated goods to sell. &#x201c;As a matter of fact, I did miss a couple of farms last time I was up that way. I&#x2019;ll change my shoes while you fetch the car.&#x201d;<br>Nick departed, his long legs making short work of the stairs.<br>The Incorruptible&#x2019;s aged engine did not make short work of the hill out of Port Mabyn. It groaned upward, past the newsagent&#x2019;s and Chin&#x2019;s Chinese, the Trelawny Arms and the minisupermarket, then between hedge-banks bright with ragwort and garlanded with red and orange bryony berries and the white fluff of old-man&#x2019;s beard. This stretch of coast was all cliffs, two or three hundred feet high. The lanes wound about some distance inland, so that for the most part the sea was invisible.<br>Directed by Eleanor, who knew the maze of lanes like the back of her hand, Nick left the B road and drove through tiny hamlets, Bothiwick, Trewarmett, then cut across country to avoid Tintagel, where the street was often a tourist traffic jam. At one point, a stretch of higher, open land allowed occasional glimpses of a dark blue line of sea meeting the pale blue of the sky on the far horizon.<br>Beyond the small village of Bossiney, the road wiggled through a patch of woodland. The dark green footpath sign was easy to miss, but Nick spotted it. They pulled over and he got out. Teazle was about to jump out after him, but as she scrabbled over the gear lever from the backseat, Eleanor grabbed the end of the lead. Not that there was much traffic, but cars tended to come much too fast round the blind corner.<br>&#x201c;She can come with me,&#x201d; Nick offered. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much mischief she can get into, and you won&#x2019;t be long, will you?&#x201d;<br>Eleanor checked her watch. &#x201c;About half an hour. All right. You behave yourself, Teazle.&#x201d; She handed over the lead to Nick and told him, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let her off till you&#x2019;re away from the road.&#x201d; She went round to the driver&#x2019;s seat and drove on.<br>The first farm she called at offered a couple of old wooden cart wheels with iron rims. The farmer&#x2019;s wife said her husband had found them at the back of the hayloft in the barn. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine why or when someone had lugged them up there. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen such set up roundabout furriners&#x2019; houses,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;so I thought you might be able to sell &#x2019;em. They&#x2019;re no earthly use to us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lovely,&#x201d; said Eleanor. &#x201c;People like to make garden fences with them. We get a good price once they&#x2019;re cleaned up and polished.&#x201d; Jocelyn, the vicar&#x2019;s wife who ran the shop, could be counted on to turn the battered, grimy wheels into decorative &#x201c;antiques.&#x201d;<br>They wouldn&#x2019;t fit in the boot. The farmer had to be called to manoeuvre them into the backseat. As she hurried&#x2014;insofar as the car was capable of hurrying&#x2014;back towards Rocky Valley, Eleanor pictured Teazle sitting in among the spokes on the way home and she laughed.<br>She parked in the lay-by opposite the footpath, no more than a gravelled widening of the road. A moment later, a dark grey plainclothes police Mini stopped nose to nose with the Incorruptible.<br>&#x201c;Nick decided not to come?&#x201d; Did Megan soun...</p><h2>Active Korean 4 (Korean edition)</h2><p>Active Korean 4<br>This is the fourth book series developed for learners who want to develop practical Korean communication skills in a short period of time. <br> <br> Based on context and function-centered instruction, it consists of practical and basic contents used in everyday life.

Money is energy, and energy is limitless. Only our fear and our limited way of thinking make money seem scarce. Using the tools and the exercises in Chapter Three, you can reconnect with the sacred origins of money, and direct the flow of money through your life and the world on a current of love, joy, goodwill and abundance. <p> Money is energy, and according to quantum physics the universe is made up of energy, which becomes matter only when information is focused on it. Wood is wood and not iron because of the information that forms the two different kinds of matter. Too many of us labor under the belief that money is "a necessary evil," which is, more often than not, difficult to obtain. By changing our feelings about money from fear, anger, greed and scarcity, to love, joy, abundance and goodwill, we can change the way money moves through our lives and the lives of others all over the world. "MONEY IS LOVE" teaches that as we begin to remove the negative thoughts and feelings that surround money and redefine money as love, we bring the power of love into all of our monetary transactions. This in turn opens our hearts to allow money to flow abundantly into our lives, creating a place of peace and joy. From this place of harmony we can then send money back out into the world on a flow of love and gratitude. Money healed can begin to heal all that it touches. And because money flows like blood through the planet, diseased it causes disease, but infused with love, money can become rejuvenating. This work stands out from other transformational money theories, because it deals with not only healing our personal relationship with money, but with healing the money itself, returning it to its sacred roots and then using this money infused with love as an agent for healing "Money is the blood of the planet. Heal the money and we can heal the world." Page 82.</p></p><p>Barbara Wilder began studying the metaphysics of money the moment she got her first allowance. From the beginning money both fascinated and repelled her. Educated as an actress, dancer and writer, she stumbled into a career budgeting films and projecting costs as a production accountant on motion pictures. Her spiritual education in The School of Actualism, an hermetic mystery school, where she studied for eleven years, came fast on the heels of her accounting career, and it was during this time that she began to uncover the inherent truths about money and the part it plays in spiritual lesson learning. Ms. Wilder has been teaching light-energy healing and transformational work for fifteen years."A searchlight into the dark mystery of wealth, MONEY IS LOVE illuminates unexamined terrain. Seekers of balance in this material life, start here to remember the true power in your cash flow. A challenging and fun way to change your mind about money." -- <i>Dennis Robertson, C.E.O., Ashoka Credit Union</i><br><br>"Barbara has created a simple, hands-on approach to cleaning up our relationship to money on both a personal and global scale.

During his travels he produced more than five hundred watercolor sketches&#x2014;many published here for the first time&#x2014;of the often dramatic scenery and exotic peoples. He also kept a detailed daily journal, extensively quoted in this book for the first time.<br><br> But this is also the story of Lucy, his spirited and intrepid wife, and their son, Alatau Tamchiboulac, named after their favorite places and born in a remote Cossack fort. They both shared Atkinson&#x2019;s many adventures&#x2014;enduring extremes of heat and cold, traveling on horseback up and down precipices and across dangerous rivers, escaping a murder plot atop a great cliff, and befriending the famous Decembrist exiles. Their true live adventures are sure to appeal to history and travel enthusiasts in equal measure.</p><p><b>John Massey Stewart</b> is an authority on Russia and the former Soviet Union. He is a co-founder of the London Initiative on the Russian Environment."Essential reading . . . . The Atkinsons were pioneers in every sense, and their immersion in a time and place was rarely matched. What is more, by emphasising the integral role of Lucy Atkinson, Massey Stewart makes a valuable effort to rebalance the gender prejudices of the period. These were, after all, not Thomas&#x2019;s adventures alone. His life, his travels, and his accounts, were altogether richer for her involvement, and this is worthy of both recognition and celebration."

He ran away before taking his final vows and joined the army. Soon afterwards, the German tanks rolled into Poland and easily defeated her antiquated forces - the Polish cavalry were armed with sabres. Krupa survived Hitler&#39;s invasion, but was arrested in Soviet-occupied eastern Poland and accused of spying. After enduring torture in Moscow&#39;s notorious Lubianka prison, he was sentenced to ten years&#39; corrective labour and deported to the Pechora Gulag. Most prisoners there were worked and starved to death within a year. But Krupa managed again to escape, and in the chaos following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union made one of the most extraordinary journeys of the war - from Siberia to safety in Afghanistan. Krupa&#39;s Jesuit training had given him an inner strength and resilience which enabled him to survive in the face of appalling brutality and cruelty. Luck and the kindness of strangers helped him complete his epic journey to freedom.

(suspense).</p><p>ROBERT HARRIS is the author of <i>An Officer and a Spy, Fatherland, Enigma, Archangel, Pompeii, Imperium, Lustrum</i>, and <i>The Ghost</i>, all of which were international bestsellers. His work has been translated into thirty-seven languages. After graduating with a degree in English from Cambridge University, he worked as a reporter for the BBC's Panorama and Newsnight programmes, before becoming political editor of the <i>Observer</i> and subsequently a columnist on the <i>Sunday Times </i>and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. He is married to Gill Hornby and they live with their four children in a village near Hungerford.I<br><br>I remember the cries of caesar&#x2019;s war-horns chasing us over the darkened fields of Latium&#x2014;their yearning, keening howls, like animals in heat&#x2014;and how when they stopped there was only the slither of our shoes on the icy road and the urgent panting of our breath.<br><br>It was not enough for the immortal gods that Cicero should be spat at and reviled by his fellow citizens; not enough that in the middle of the night he be driven from the hearths and altars of his family and ancestors; not enough even that as we fled from Rome on foot he should look back and see his house in flames. To all these torments they deemed it necessary to add one further refinement: that he should be forced to hear his enemy&#x2019;s army striking camp on the Field of Mars.<br><br>Even though he was the oldest of our party Cicero kept up the same fast pace as the rest of us. Not long ago he had held Caesar&#x2019;s life in the palm of his hand. He could have crushed it as easily as an egg. Now their fortunes led them in entirely opposite directions. While Cicero hurried south to escape his enemies, the architect of his destruction marched north to take command of both provinces of Gaul.<br><br>He walked with his head down, not uttering a word and I imagined it was because he was too full of despair to speak. Only at dawn, when we rendezvoused with our horses at Bovillae and were about to embark on the second stage of our escape, did he pause with his foot in the doorway of his carriage and say suddenly, &#x201c;Do you think we should turn back?&#x201d;<br><br>The question caught me by surprise. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hadn&#x2019;t considered it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, consider it now. Tell me: why are we fleeing Rome?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius and his mob.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And why is Clodius so powerful?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s a tribune and can pass laws against you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And who made it possible for him to become a tribune?&#x201d;<br><br>I hesitated. &#x201c;Caesar.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly. Caesar. Do you imagine that man&#x2019;s departure for Gaul at that precise hour was a coincidence? Of course not! He waited till his spies had reported I&#x2019;d left the city before ordering his army to move. Why? I&#x2019;d always assumed his advancement of Clodius was to punish me for speaking out against him. But what if his real aim all along was to drive me out of Rome? What scheme requires him to be certain I&#x2019;ve gone before he can leave too?&#x201d;<br><br>I should have grasped the logic of what he was saying. I should have urged him to turn back. But I was too exhausted to reason clearly. And if I am honest there was more to it than that. I was too afraid of what Clodius&#x2019;s thugs might do to us if they caught us re-entering the city.<br><br>So instead I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good question, and I can&#x2019;t pretend I have the answer. But wouldn&#x2019;t it look indecisive, after bidding goodbye to everyone, suddenly to reappear? In any case, Clodius has burned your house down now&#x2014;where would we return to? Who would take us in? I think you&#x2019;d be wiser to stick to your original plan and get as far away from Rome as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>He rested his head against the side of the carriage and closed his eyes. In the pale grey light I was shocked by how haggard he appeared after his night on the road. His hair and beard had not been cut for weeks. He was wearing a toga dyed black. Although he was only in his forty-ninth year, these public signs of mourning made him look much older&#x2014;like some ancient, mendicant holy man. After a while he sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Tiro. Perhaps you&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s so long since I slept I&#x2019;m too tired to think any more.&#x201d;<br><br>And so the fatal error was made&#x2014;more through indecision than decision&#x2014;and we continued to press on southwards for the remainder of that day and for the twelve days that followed, putting what we thought was a safe distance between ourselves and danger.<br><br>We travelled with a minimal entourage to avoid attracting attention&#x2014;just the carriage driver and three armed slaves on horseback, one in front and two behind. A small chest of gold and silver coins that Atticus, Cicero&#x2019;s oldest and closest friend, had provided to pay for our journey was hidden under our seat. We stayed only in the houses of men we trusted, no more than a night in each, and steered clear of those places where Cicero might have been expected to stop&#x2014;for example at his seaside villa at Formiae, the first place any pursuers would look for him, and along the Bay of Naples, already filling with the annual exodus from Rome in search of winter sun and warm springs. Instead we headed as fast as we could towards the toe of Italy.<br><br>Cicero&#x2019;s plan, conceived on the move, was to make for Sicily and stay there until the political agitation against him in Rome subsided. &#x201c;The mob will turn on Clodius eventually,&#x201d; he predicted. &#x201c;Such is the unalterable nature of the mob. He will always be my mortal enemy but he won&#x2019;t always be tribune&#x2014;we must never forget that. In nine months his term of office will expire and then we can go back.&#x201d;<br><br>He was confident of a friendly reception from the Sicilians, if only because of his successful prosecution of the island&#x2019;s tyrannical governor, Verres&#x2014;even though that brilliant victory, which launched his political career, was now twelve years in the past and Clodius had more recently been a magistrate in the province. I sent letters ahead giving notice of his intention to seek sanctuary, and when we reached the harbour at Regium we hired a little six-oared boat to row us across the straits to Messina.<br><br>We left the harbour on a clear cold winter morning of searing blues&#x2014;the sea and the sky; one light, one dark; the line dividing them as sharp as a blade; the distance to Messina a mere three miles. It took us less than an hour. We drew so close we could see Cicero&#x2019;s supporters lined up on the rocks to welcome him. But stationed between us and the entrance to the port was a warship flying the red and green colours of the governor of Sicily, Gaius Vergilius, and as we approached the lighthouse it slipped its anchor and moved slowly forwards to intercept us. Vergilius stood at the rail surrounded by his lictors and, after visibly recoiling at Cicero&#x2019;s dishevelled appearance, shouted down a greeting, to which Cicero replied in friendly terms. They had known one another in the Senate for many years.<br><br>Vergilius asked him his intentions.<br><br>Cicero called back that naturally he intended to come ashore.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d heard,&#x201d; replied Vergilius. &#x201c;Unhappily I can&#x2019;t allow it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because of Clodius&#x2019;s new law.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what new law would that be? There are so many, one loses count.&#x201d;<br><br>Vergilius beckoned to a member of his staff who produced a document and leaned down to pass it to me and I then gave it to Cicero. To this day I can remember how it fluttered in his hands in the slight breeze as if it were a living thing; it was the only sound in the silence. He took his time and when he had finished reading it he handed it to me without comment.<br><br>Lex Clodia in Ciceronem<br><br>Whereas M. T. Cicero has put Roman citizens to death unheard and uncondemned; and to that end forged the authority and decree of the Senate; it is hereby ordained that he be interdicted from fire and water to a distance of four hundred miles from Rome; that nobody should presume to harbour or receive him, on pain of death; that all his property and possessions be forfeit; that his house in Rome be demolished and a shrine to Liberty consecrated in its place; and that whoever shall move, speak, vote or take any step towards recalling him shall be treated as a public enemy, unless those whom Cicero unlawfully put to death should first spring back to life.<br><br>It must have been the most terrible blow. But he found the composure to dismiss it with a flick of his hand. &#x201c;When,&#x201d; he enquired, &#x201c;was this nonsense published?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m told it was posted in Rome eight days ago. It came into my hands yesterday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s not law yet, and can&#x2019;t be law until it&#x2019;s been read a third time. My secretary will confirm it. Tiro,&#x201d; he said, turning to me, &#x201c;tell the governor the earliest date it can be passed.&#x201d;<br><br>I tried to calculate. Before a bill could be put to a vote it had to be read aloud in the Forum on three successive market days. But my reasoning was so shaken by what I had just read I couldn&#x2019;t remember what day of the week it was now, let alone when the market days fell. &#x201c;Twenty days from today,&#x201d; I hazarded, &#x201c;perhaps twenty-five?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You see?&#x201d; cried Cicero. &#x201c;I have three weeks&#x2019; grace even if it passes, which I&#x2019;m sure it won&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He stood up in the prow of the boat, bracing his legs against the rocking of the hull, and spread his arms wide in appeal. &#x201c;Please, my dear Vergilius, for the sake of our past friendship, now that I have come so far, at least allow me to land and spend a night or two with my supporters.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, as I say, I&#x2019;m sorry, but I cannot take the risk. I&#x2019;ve consulted my experts. They say even if you travelled to the very western tip of the island, to Lilybaeum, you&#x2019;d still be within three hundred and fifty miles of Rome, and then Clodius would come after me.&#x201d;<br><br>At that, Cicero ceased to be so friendly. He said coldly, &#x201c;You have no right under the law to impede the journey of a Roman citizen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have every right to safeguard the tranquillity of my province. And here, as you know, my word is the law . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He was apologetic. I dare say he was even embarrassed. But he was immovable, and after a few more angry exchanges there was nothing for it but to turn round and row back to Regium. Our departure provoked a great cry of dismay from the shoreline and I could see that Cicero for the first time was seriously worried. Vergilius was a friend of his. If this was how a friend reacted then soon the whole of Italy would be closed against him. Returning to Rome to oppose the law was much too risky. He had left it too late. Apart from the physical danger such a journey would entail, the bill would almost certainly pass, and then we would be stranded four hundred miles from the legal limit it prescribed. To comply safely with the terms of his exile he would have to flee abroad immediately. Obviously Gaul was out of the question because of Caesar. So it would have to be somewhere in the East&#x2014;Greece perhaps, or Asia. But unfortunately we were on the wrong side of the peninsula to make our escape in the treacherous winter seas. We needed to get over to the opposite coast, to Brundisium on the Adriatic, and find a big ship capable of making a lengthy voyage. Our predicament was exquisitely vile&#x2014;as no doubt Caesar, the original sponsor and creator of Clodius, had intended.<br><br>it took us two weeks of arduous travel to cross the mountains, often in heavy rain and mostly along bad roads. Every mile seemed fraught with the hazard of ambush, although the primi�tive little towns we passed through were welcoming enough. At night we slept in smoky, freezing inns and dined on hard bread and fatty meat made scarcely more palatable by sour wine. Cicero&#x2019;s mood veered between fury and despair. He saw clearly now that he had made a terrible mistake by leaving Rome. It had been madness for him to quit the city and leave Clodius free to spread the calumny that he had put citizens to death &#x201c;unheard and uncondemned&#x201d; when in fact each of the five Catiline conspirators had been allowed to speak in his own defence and their execution had been sanctioned by the entire Senate. But his flight was tantamount to an admission of guilt. He should have obeyed his instinct and turned back when he heard Caesar&#x2019;s departing trumpets and first began to realise his error. He wept at the disaster his folly and timidity had brought upon his wife and children.<br><br>And when he had finished lashing himself, he turned his scourge on Hortensius &#x201c;and the rest of the aristocratic gang,&#x201d; who had never forgiven him for rising from his humble origins to the consulship and saving the republic: they had deliberately urged him to flee in order to ruin him. He should have heeded the example of Socrates, who said that death was preferable to exile. Yes, he should have killed himself! He snatched up a knife from the dining table. He would kill himself! I said nothing. I didn&#x2019;t take the threat seriously. He couldn&#x2019;t stand the sight of others&#x2019; blood, let alone his own. All his life he had tried to avoid military expeditions, the games, public executions, funerals&#x2014;anything that might remind him of mortality. If pain frightened him, death terrified him&#x2014;which, although I would never have been impertinent enough to point it out, was the principal reason we had fled Rome in the first place.<br><br>When finally we came within sight of the fortified walls of Brundisium, he decided not to venture inside. The port was so large and busy, so full of strangers, and so likely to be his desti�n�ation, he was convinced it was the obvious spot for his assassination. Instead we sought sanctuary a little way up the coast, in the residence of his old friend Marcus Laenius Flaccus. That night we slept in decent beds for the first time in three weeks, and the next morning we went down to the beach. The waves were much rougher than on the Sicilian side. A strong wind was hurling the Adriatic relentlessly against the rocks and shingle. Cicero loathed sea voyages at the best of times; this one promised to be especially treacherous. Yet it was our only means of escape. One hundred and twenty miles beyond the horizon lay the shore of Illyricum.<br><br>Flaccus, noticing his expression, said, &#x201c;Fortify your spirits, Cicero&#x2014;perhaps the bill won&#x2019;t pass, or one of the other tribunes will veto it. There must be someone left in Rome willing to stand up for you&#x2014;Pompey, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>But Cicero, his gaze still fixed out to sea, made no reply, and a few days later we heard that the bill had indeed become law and that Flaccus was therefore guilty of a capital offence simply by having a convicted exile on his premises. Even so he tried to persuade us to stay. He insisted that Clodius didn&#x2019;t frighten him. But Cicero wouldn&#x2019;t hear of it: &#x201c;Your loyalty moves me, old friend, but that monster will have dispatched a team of his hired fighters to hunt me down the moment his law passed. There is no time to lose.&#x201d;<br><br>I had found a merchant ship in the harbour at Brundisium whose hard-pressed master was willing to risk a winter voyage across the Adriatic in return for a huge fee, and the next morning at first light, when no one was around, we went on board. She was a sturdy, broad-beamed vessel, with a crew of about twenty, used to ply the trade route between Italy and Dyrrachium. I was no judge of these things, but she looked safe enough to me. The master estimated the crossing would require a day and a half&#x2014;but we needed to leave quickly, he said, and take advantage of the favourable wind. So while the sailors made her ready and Flaccus waited on the quayside, Cicero quickly dictated a final message to his wife and children: It has been a fine life, a great career&#x2014;the good in me, nothing bad, has brought me down. My dear Terentia, loyalest and best of wives, my darling daughter Tullia, and little Marcus, our one remaining hope&#x2014;goodbye! I copied it out and passed it up to Flaccus. He raised his hand in farewell. Then the sail was unfurled, the cables cast off, the oarsmen pushed us away from the harbour wall, and we set off into the pale grey light.<br><br>at first we made good speed. cicero stood high above the deck on the steersmen&#x2019;s platform, leaning on the stern rail, watching the great lighthouse of Brundisium recede behind us. Apart from his visits to Sicily, it was the first time he had left Italy since his youth, when he went to Rhodes to learn oratory from Molon. Of all the men I ever knew, Cicero was the least equipped by temperament for exile. To thrive he needed the appurtenances of civilised society&#x2014;friends, news...</p><h2>Convergences: Essays on Art and Literature</h2><p>Engrossing essays that reflect the author&#x2019;s vast and subtle knowledge of the world.

She now writes bestselling single title cowboy and country music mass market romances. Born in Texas and raised in southern Oklahoma, Carolyn and her husband now make their home in the town of Davis, Oklahoma.</p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p> <p>It was just a white frame house at the end of a long lane.</p> <p>But it did not have wheels.</p> <p>Liz squinted against the sun sinking in the west and imagined it with multicolored Christmas lights strung all around the porch, the windows, even in the cedar tree off to the left side. In her vision, it was a Griswold house from Christmas Vacation that lit up the whole state of Texas. She hoped that when she flipped the switch she didn't cause a major blackout because in a few weeks it was going to look like the house on that old movie that she loved.</p> <p>Now where was the cowboy to complete the package?</p> <p>Christmas lights on a house without wheels and a cowboy in tight fittin' jeans and in boots-that's what she asked for every year when her mother asked for her Christmas list. She didn't remember the place being so big when she visited her uncle those two times. Once when she was ten and then again when she was fourteen. But both of those times she'd been quite taken with the young cowboy next door and didn't pay much attention to the house itself. The brisk Texas wind whipped around ferociously as if saying that it could send her right back to east Texas if she didn't change her mind about the house.</p> <p>"I don't think so," she giggled. "I know a thing or two about Texas wind, and it'd take more than a class five tornado to get rid of me. This is what I've wanted all my life, and I think it's the prettiest house in Montague County. It's sittin' on a foundation, and oh, my God, he's left Hooter and Blister for me. Uncle Haskell, I could kiss you!"</p> <p>The wind pushed its way into the truck, bringing a few fall leaves with it when she opened the truck door. Aunt Tressa would say that was an omen; the place was welcoming her into its arms. Her mother would say that the wind was blowing her back to the carnival where she belonged.</p> <p>The old dog, Hooter, slowly came down off the porch, head down, wagging his tail. Blister, the black and white cat, eyed her suspiciously from the ladder-back chair on the tiny porch.</p> <p>Her high heels sunk into the soft earth, leaving holes as she rushed across the yard toward the yellow dog. She squatted down, hugged the big yellow mutt, and scratched his ears. "You beautiful old boy. You are the icing on the cake. Now I've got animals and a house. This is a damn fine night."</p> <p>The key was under the chair, tucked away in a faded ceramic frog, just where her Uncle Haskell said it would be when she talked to him earlier that afternoon. But he hadn't mentioned leaving the two animals. She'd thank him for that surprise when she called him later on.</p> <p>She opened the wooden screen door and was about to put the key in the lock when the door swung open. And there he was! Raylen O'Donnell, all grown up and even sexier than she remembered. Her heart thumped so hard she could feel it pushing against her bra. Her hands were shaky and her knees weak, but she took a deep breath, willed her hands to be still, and locked her knees in place.</p> <p>"If it's religion you're sellin' or anything else, we're not interested," Raylen said in a deep Texas drawl. He'd been pouring a glass of tea in the kitchen when he heard a noise. Hooter hadn't barked, so he figured it was just the wind, but when he opened the door he'd been more shocked than the woman standing there with wide eyes and a spooked expression on her face.</p> <p>She wore skintight black jeans that looked like they'd been spray painted on her slim frame. Without those spike heels she would've barely come to his shoulder, and Raylen was the shortest of the three O'Donnell brothers, tipping the chart at five feet ten inches. Her jet-black hair had been twisted up and clipped, but strands had escaped the shiny silver clasp and found their way to her shoulder. Her eyes were so dark brown that they looked ebony.</p> <p>"Raylen?" she said.</p> <p>Her voice was husky, with a touch of gravel, adding to her exotic looks. It made Raylen think of rye whiskey with a teaspoon of honey and a twist of lemon. He'd heard that voice before. It had been branded on his brain for eleven years, but she couldn't be Haskell's niece. Liz wasn't supposed to be there until the first of the week at the earliest.</p> <p>"That's right. Who are you?" he asked cautiously.</p> <p>"I happen to own this place," she said with a flick of her hand.</p> <p>"Liz?" Raylen started at her toes and let his gaze travel slowly all the way to her eyebrows. She'd been a pretty teenager, but now she was a stunning woman.</p> <p>"Surprise! I guess this chunk of Texas dirt now belongs to me. What are you doing here?" she asked.</p> <p>Could Raylen really be the cowboy Santa was going to leave under her Christmas tree? He'd sure enough been the one she had in mind when she asked for a cowboy. She'd visualized him in tight fittin' jeans and boots when she was younger. Lately, she'd changed it to nothing but a Santa hat and the boots.</p> <p>His hair was still a rich, dark brown, almost black until the sunlight lit up the deep chestnut color. His eyes were exactly as she remembered: pale, icy blue rimmed with dark brown lashes. It all added up to a heady combination, enough to make her want to tangle her hands up in all that dark hair and kiss him until she swooned like a heroine in one of those old castle romances she'd read since she was a teenager. Speaking of kissing, where in the hell was the mistletoe when a woman needed it, anyway?</p> <p>Cowboys have roots, not wings. Don't get involved with one or you'll smother to death in a remote backwoods farm or else die of boredom. Her mother's voice whispered so close to her ear that she turned to make sure Marva Jo Hanson hadn't followed her to Ringgold, Texas.</p> <p>Raylen stood to one side. "I came to feed and water Hooter and Blister. Haskell asked me to do that until you got here. We met when we were kids, remember?"</p> <p>"I do," she said. How could she forget? She'd been in love with Raylen O'Donnell since she was fourteen years old.</p> <p>"Haskell said that if you didn't like it here, he'd sell me your twenty acres." Now that was a helluva thing to blurt out, but he couldn't very well say that she'd grown up to be the most exotic creature he'd ever laid eyes on. He'd thought she was cuter than any girl he'd ever seen when she was about fourteen or fifteen, but he hadn't realized that she'd only been the bud of the rose. The full-blown flower was standing before him right then, making him fidget like a little boy.</p> <p>"I'm going to live here. Uncle Haskell said if I like it, he'll deed the place over to me in the spring. The place isn't for sale and won't be," she said.</p> <p>"And do what? Ringgold isn't very big."</p> <p>She shrugged. "I don't know. Pet the cat. Feed the dog."</p> <p>"That won't make a living, lady," Raylen said.</p> <p>She popped both hands on her hips. "I don't reckon what I do for a living is one damn bit of your business, cowboy. Do you intend to let me come into my house?"</p> <p>Why in the hell was he arguing with her? Never in all the scenarios that she'd imagined did he cross her. He'd kissed her. He'd swept her off her feet and carried her to a big white pickup truck and they'd driven off into the sunset. He'd smiled and said that he remembered her well and she'd grown up into a beautiful woman. But he hadn't argued.</p> <p>Raylen motioned her into the house with a wave of his hand. She brushed across his chest as she entered the house and was acutely aware of the sparks dancing all over the room but attributed it to anger or disappointment, maybe even a bitter dose of both. She'd had Raylen on a pedestal for more than a decade and he didn't even recognize her. He was probably married and had three or four kids too. That was just her luck!</p> <p>When she fanned past him he got a whiff of a sensuous perfume that went with her dark, gypsy looks, and he wanted to follow after her like a lost puppy dog.</p> <p>"I'll take over feeding the cat and dog," she said.</p> <p>"Okay, then here's the key Haskell gave me." He dug into his pocket and handed her an old key ring with two keys on it. "Welcome to Ringgold, Liz. I still live on the ranch that surrounds this land. Haskell sold me most of his ranch six months ago, all but the part the house sits on."</p> <p>"He told me."</p> <p>Raylen headed for the door, "The O'Donnells are your closest neighbors. Come around to see us sometime. Be seein' you."</p> <p>She wanted to say something; she really did. But not one word would come out of her mouth. Raylen in her living room, looking even sexier than he had when he was seventeen and exercising the horses. Raylen, all grown up, a man instead of a lanky teenager, talking to her... it was such a shock and a surprise that she was speechless. And that was strange territory for Lizelle Hanson.</p> <p>"Dammit!" she swore.</p> <p>The noise of the truck engine filled the house for a moment then faded. She'd been so stunned to see him that she couldn't think straight. She hadn't known what to expect, but it sure wasn't what she got. She fished a cell phone from her jacket pocket and punched a speed dial number.</p> <p>"I'm here," she said when her mother answered.</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>Liz giggled nervously. "It's bigger than I remembered, and there's a sexy cowboy who lives next door but he's probably married and has six kids because no guy that pretty isn't taken. I'd forgotten how big the house is after living in the carnie trailer."</p> <p>"Have you unpacked? You can turn around and come back right now. You could be here in time to take your shift tomorrow night, and my brother can sell it to those horse ranchers next door to him."</p> <p>"Not yet. I was on my way in the house when Raylen opened the door and scared the hell out of me. Hooter and Blister are still alive and well. I'm not ready to throw in the towel yet."</p> <p>"Raylen?" Marva Jo asked.</p> <p>"The sexy cowboy. I met him both times I came to visit Uncle Haskell. Remember when I told you about the boy that tried to beat me walkin' the fence when I was ten? That was Raylen."</p> <p>"You are right. He's probably married and has a couple of kids. I was hoping the house would be butt ugly to you."</p> <p>"No, ma'am. I squinted real hard and even imagined it with Christmas lights. Looked pretty damn fine," Liz said.</p> <p>"We'll be in Bowie in a few weeks. By then you'll be sick to death of boredom. You were born for the carnie and travel," Marva said.</p> <p>"I will have the Christmas lights on the house when you get here," Liz said.</p> <p>"A house not on wheels with Christmas lights and a cowboy." Marva laughed. "Be careful that the latter doesn't cut off your beautiful wings, because that part of the country produces a crop of hot cowboys every generation."</p> <p>"Good night, Momma. I love you," Liz said.</p> <p>"Love you too, kid. Go prove me right about getting bored to tears. It's only half an hour until time to tell fortunes and I still have to get my makeup on. Does that make you miss me?"</p> <p>"Not yet. I only saw you this morning. Hug Aunt Tressa and I'll see you in a few weeks."</p> <p>***</p> <p>Raylen drove down the lane and stopped. The left blinker was on, but he couldn't make himself pull out onto the highway. The whole incident at Haskell's place had been surreal. Haskell said his niece, Liz, was going to take over the property. He remembered Liz very well. She was the ten-year-old who'd walked the rail fence better than him even though he was thirteen. She was the fourteen-year-old who rested her elbows on the same rail fence and watched him exercise the horses. Now she was so pretty she sucked every sane thought out of his brain.</p> <p>He finally pulled out on Highway 81 and headed north a mile, then turned left into the O'Donnell horse ranch. She'd find out pretty quick that a person couldn't make a living by petting the cat and feeding the dog, and when she did he intended to be the first in line to buy her twenty acres. It was the only property for a three-mile stretch down the highway that didn't belong to the O'Donnells.</p> <p>He parked in the backyard, crawled out of the truck, and sat down on the porch step to his folks' house. Dewar drove up, parked next to him, hopped out of his truck, and swaggered to the porch. Just a year older than Raylen, Dewar was taller by several inches. His hair was so black that it had a faint blue cast as the sunrays bounced off it. His eyes were a strange mossy shade of green and his face square. His Wranglers were tight and dusty; his boots were worn down at the heels and covered with mud.</p> <p>"Y'all get those cattle worked at Rye's?" Raylen looked down at his own boots. They were just as worn down at the heels and covered with horseshit. His jeans had a hole in one knee and frayed hems on both pant legs. His shirt looked like it had been thrown out in the round horse corral for a solid week and then used for a dog bed a month after that. Damn it all to the devil and back again. He'd planned on at least meeting Liz the first time in clean duds, not looking like a bum off the streets.</p> <p>"Yes, we did, and we would've got them done sooner if our younger brother would've helped," Dewar said.</p> <p>"Aww, y'all didn't need me. And besides, if you worked harder and played with Rachel less, you'd get more done."</p> <p>"Bullshit! You're just tryin' to find excuses." Dewar grinned.</p> <p>Rachel was their oldest brother's new baby daughter, the first O'Donnell grandchild, and only a few months old. Her father, Rye, was Raylen and Dewar's oldest brother. Her mother, Austin, had been a Tulsa socialite until she inherited a watermelon farm across the river in Terral, Oklahoma, and fell in love with Rye. Rachel was getting to know her two uncles and it was an ongoing battle about which one would be the favorite.</p> <p>"Want a beer? I swear I'm spittin' dust and hot summer is long since past," Dewar said.</p> <p>"I'd drink a beer with you," Raylen said.</p> <p>Dewar disappeared into the house and brought out two longneck bottles of Coors, and he handed one to Raylen. "So you got the chores done around here or am I going to have to do those too?"</p> <p>"All finished. Everything with four legs has been fed and watered. Horses are all exercised, and even Haskell's dog and cat are fed. His niece is over there now. She can take care of Hooter and Blister." He turned up the bottle and downed a fourth of it before coming up for air and a burp.</p> <p>Dewar plopped down on the porch step beside Raylen. "Is she going to keep the place or do you have a chance at buying it?"</p> <p>"Says she is going to keep it. I asked her what she was going to do to make a living in Ringgold, Texas, and she said she was going to feed the dog and pet the cat. Hell, if Haskell gives her his money as well as that twenty acres, she won't have to do nothing but feed a dog and pet a cat."</p> <p>"What's she look like?"</p> <p>"Damn fine. Not a thing like old Haskell. She's got jet-black hair and the blackest eyes you've ever seen, and her skin is this light toast color that says she's got some kind of exotic blood in her. Build like a red brick outhouse without a single brick out of place."</p> <p>"You took with her?"</p> <p>"Hell, no!" Raylen said too quickly.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Liz stood in the middle of the living room floor and turned around slowly. The room was bigger than the fi...</p></p><h2>Grafica della Strada: The Signs of Italy</h2><p>For more than three decades, renowned graphic designer and self-described Italophile Louise Fili has traveled the cities and countryside of Italy cataloging the work of sign craftsmen in whose hands type takes on new life with a tantalizing menu of styles.

Much like Bruce Wayne, Grave is single and rich, uses expensive gadgets and has a vigilante alter ego. Hokey dialogue (I respect anyone willing to die for a cause.... My goal is to help [terrorists] die for their cause. But I still respect them) hampers an otherwise entertaining read as Grave investigates the disappearance of investigative reporter Tibor Rothman, husband of Grave's ex-wife, Ellen. Sheriff Gail Bonneville of Samson, Ind., is chasing Grave in turn, since a hostage rescue mission he fronted turned into a shootout. Thriller fans may not mind the cheesiness or flat characters like brutish pilot Boxers and sassy computer specialist Venice (pronounced Ven-EE-chay, by the way), as this fast-paced tale of violence and revenge is all about plot, of which there is plenty. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now, Wade Bradford takes readers on a trip through time for a humorous look at how bed-making has evolved throughout history.&nbsp; Using examples of household tasks that might have been performed in colonial America, in ancient Egypt, by Vikings, and so on, this clever examination of chore lore eventually reveals the answer to this age-old question.

It&#x2019;s &#x201c;just going to get messed up again.&#x201d; His complaints remind his mother of a story about when his grandmother was a little girl and fumed that she had already washed the dishes, dusted the rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll records, and picked up her hula hoops. Why did she have to make her bed? Her mother remembers her grandfather as a little boy, and the stories continue right back to cave times (&#x201c;Me hunt mammoth. Me dust stalagmites&#x201d;).

Michael Connelly, Ridley Pearson, John Lescroart, Don Winslow, Melodie Johnson Howe, Victoria Houston, and others all share a mysterious affection for things piscatorial when not busy writing best-selling books. This collection of all-original short stories will entertain even the most discriminating mystery reader.<br><br> Proceeds from this book will help support two charitable groups, Casting For Recovery, which helps women cancer survivors to heal body and soul through fly-fishing, and Project Healing Waters, which does the same for our returning veterans.<br><br> Contributing authors include � Ridley Pearson � Mark T. Sullivan � Michael Connelly � John Lescoart � Andrew Winer � Dana Stabenow � Don Winslow � Melodie Johnson Howe � James W. Hall � C.J. Box � Victoria Houston � William Beall � Spring Warren � Brian M. Wiprud � William Tapply � T. Jefferson Parker</p><p>T. Jefferson Parker is the best-selling author of Iron River and California Girl. He lives in San Diego, CA.Fishing can be murder both literally and figuratively, as shown in this rich string of 16 original stories caught and displayed by bestseller Parker. Not all are trophy worthy, but most are keepers, like Mr. Brody's Trout by the late William G. Tapply, in which bait shop owner Stoney Calhoun guides an elderly fisherman on a monthlong quest for a ten-pound native Maine brook trout. Dana Stabenow's Kate Shugak solves a missing person case and metes out poetic justice in her Alaskan village in Cherchez La Femme. In John Lescroart's clever Unsnaggable, a Yellowstone fishing trip offers a spouse the chance to exit a marriage. Three brief fishing lessons from a hit man teach a suicidal man a life lesson in Brian M. Wiprud's provocative Granite Hat. Other contributors include Michael Connelly, Ridley Pearson, C.J. Box, and James W. Hall. This solid anthology demonstrates that a passion for fishing and a passion for writing can hook a reader and reel him in. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(starred review) (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>"The lyrical free verse is enhanced by Chodos-Irvine''s colorful linocuts. The blocky yet realistic prints fit the mood perfectly and bring subtle layers of interpretation to the words, as when tiny sunlike fireflies are added to the dusk scene in which the flower is ''thinking about the sun/even when it has gone away.'' Younger children will enjoy the concrete imagery while older readers will appreciate the effortlessly evoked themes of seasons, life cycle, and the miracles of nature."

Clean, bright with like new binding book is good enough to be given as a new book gift. We appreciate your business and welcome any questions</p><p><i>Hugh Johnson's Modern Encyclopedia of Wine</i> is an indispensable reference book for all wine lovers. Johnson's strength is taking the incredibly complex subject of wine and making it accessible to any reader, from the occasional wine drinker to the serious connoisseur. The heart of the book, though, is the large middle section, "Wines, Vineyards, and Winemakers of the World." Organized by region, all of the major winemaking countries are included, as well as a host of emerging ones. With 7,000 entries, the book is one of the most comprehensive guides available, and unlike comparable volumes such as <i>The Oxford Companion to Wine</i>, Johnson includes tasting notes for many of the wines and winemakers reviewed. The other two sections of the book, "Modern Wines" and "Enjoying Wine," provide the essential information needed to understand the production of wine and how to choose and store wines. Johnson is a rare writer who can match the depth of his knowledge with equal breadth and width. Couple the <i>Modern Encyclopedia of Wine</i> with Johnson's earlier volume, <i>The World Atlas of Wine</i>, and it is hard to imagine any more exhaustive, or better, reference available today. <i>--Mark O.

Today's retirees are now responsible for creating their own stream of income from their investments - and this income may need to last for more than three decades. So, the singular question every retiree needs to ask is:<br><br>Am I going to outlive my money, or is my money going to outlive me?<br><br>Plan on Living: The Retiree's Guide to Lasting Income and Enduring Wealth addresses this question and many more about the management of retirement assets. The concepts taught within the pages of this book will demonstrate how a retirement income plan should be constructed and monitored to enable the retiree to transition a career's worth of accumulations into a lifetime's worth of income. With such a plan for living in place, retirees can truly plan on living the abundant retirement they dream of.</p><p>Scott M. Peterson is the founder and principal investment advisor of Peterson Wealth Advisors. Scott has broken ground in the retirement planning industry as the architect of the Perennial Income Model, a planning tool that helps retirees manage their investments throughout retirement. Scott has authored two books on managing money during retirement and often speaks regarding this topic. Thanks to his three decades of research and his collaborative approach with legal and tax professional s in the managing of finances during retirement, he has positioned himself to offer unique insights on the issues facing today&#39;s retirees.</p><h2>The Skin Chairs (Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p>After her father&#39;s death, Frances, ten, her mother, two brothers, and three sisters have difficulty adjusting to diminished circumstances and a domineering aunt</p><p>Barbara Comyns (1909-92) was born in Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire.

The Cherokees had an early turbulent history dealing with the Spanish, French, and English invaders. Having fought on the side of the British during the American Revolution, they continued to fight the Americans after the war ended, but soon signed a peace treaty with them. In 1794 some Cherokees left the old homeland in the Appalachian Mountains and settled in Missouri for a time, but the 1811 earthquake drove them out to Arkansas. In 1838 the U.S. government drove most of the rest of the Cherokees out to resettle in what is now northeast Oklahoma. During the U.S. Civil War, some Cherokees became Confederate soldiers and fought for the South. A reconstruction treaty called for organizing the Cherokee Nation into a new Indian Territory, leading to the state of Oklahoma. In this informative new book, readers will gain an understanding of the history of the Cherokee people, their struggles and triumphs, and the way they live today.</p><p>Robert J.

Using classical, popular, and avant-garde music as texts, Schwarz addresses intriguing questions: why do bodies develop goose bumps when listening to music and why does music sound so good when heard "all around?" By concentrating on music as cultural artifact, <i>Listening Subjects</i> shows how the historical conditions under which music is created affect the listening experience.<br>Schwarz applies the ideas of post-Lacanian psychoanalytic theorists Slavoj Zizek, Julia Kristeva, and Kaja Silverman to an analysis of diverse works. In a discussion of John Adams&#x2019;s opera <i>Nixon in China</i>, he presents music listening as a fantasy of being enclosed in a second skin of enveloping sound. He looks at the song cycles of Franz Schubert as an examination and expression of epistemological doubts at the advent of modernism, and traverses fantasy "space" in his exploration of the white noise at the end of the Beatles&#x2019; "I Want You (She&#x2019;s So Heavy)." Schwarz also considers the psychosexual undercurrent in Peter Gabriel&#x2019;s "Intruder" and the textual and ideological structures of German Oi Musik. Concluding with a reading of two compositions by Diamanda Gal�s, he reveals how some performances can simultaneously produce terror and awe, abjection and rage, pleasure and displeasure. This multilayered study transcends other interventions in the field of musicology, particularly in its groundbreaking application of literary theory to popular and classical music. <br></p><p>&#34;Schwarz has a keen music-analytical sense, a solid grounding in psychoanalysis, and an effervescent intellectual energy. His project is a fresh and distinctive addition to the ongoing rapprochement between musicology, critical theory, and cultural studies.&#34;--Lawrence Kramer, Fordham University<p>David Schwarz is Valentine Professor of Music at Amherst College.<br></p></p><h2>Erotic Domination</h2><p>China Hamilton describes his photographs which fill the pages of Erotic Domination: &#34;The models and I attempted to produce work that would appeal to a wide audience.

A HEAT WAVE IN THE MIDDLE of the school holidays, exactly where it belonged. Every morning the sun was up long before they were, making a mockery of the flimsy summer curtains that hung limply at their bedroom windows, a sun already hot and sticky with promise before Olivia even opened her eyes. Olivia, as reliable as a rooster, always the first to wake, so that no one in the house had bothered with an alarm clock since she was born three years ago.<br>&nbsp;<br>Olivia, the youngest and therefore the one currently sleeping in the small back bedroom with the nursery-rhyme wallpaper, a room that all of them had occupied and been ousted from in turn. Olivia, as cute as a button, they were all agreed, even Julia who had taken a long time to get over being displaced as the baby of the family, a position she had occupied for five satisfying years before Olivia came along.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rosemary, their mother, said that she wished Olivia could stay at this age for ever because she was so <i>lovable</i>. They had never heard her use that word to describe any of them. They had not even realized that such a word existed in her vocabulary, which was usually restricted to tedious commands &#x2013; <i>come here, go away, be quiet, </i>and &#x2013; most frequent of all &#x2013; <i>stop that</i>. Sometimes she would walk into a room or appear in the garden, glare at them and say, <i>whatever it is you&#x2019;re doing, don&#x2019;t</i>, and then simply walk away again, leaving them feeling aggrieved and badly done by, even when caught red-handed in the middle of some piece of mischief &#x2013; devised by Sylvia usually.<br>&nbsp;<br>Their capacity for wrongdoing, especially under Sylvia&#x2019;s reckless leader ship, was apparently limitless. The eldest three were (everyone agreed) &#x2018;a handful&#x2019;, too close together in age to be distinguishable to their mother so that they had evolved into a collective child to which she found it hard to attribute individual details and which she addressed at random &#x2013; <i>Julia-Sylvia-Amelia-whoever you are </i>&#x2013; said in an exasperated tone as if it was their fault there were so many of them. Olivia was usually excluded from this weary litany; Rosemary never seemed to get her mixed up with the rest of them.<br>&nbsp;<br>They had supposed Olivia would be the last to occupy the small back bedroom and that one day the nursery-rhyme wallpaper would finally be scraped off (by their harassed mother because their father said hiring a professional decorator was a waste of money) and be replaced by something more grown-up &#x2013; flowers or perhaps ponies, although anything would be better than the Elastoplast pink adorning the room that Julia and Amelia shared, a colour that had looked so promising to the two of them on the paint chart and proved so alarming on the walls and which their mother said she didn&#x2019;t have the time or money (or <i>energy</i>) to replace.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now it transpired that Olivia was going to be undertaking the same rite of passage as her older sisters, leaving behind the &#x2013; rather badly aligned &#x2013; Humpty-Dumptys and Little Miss Muffets to make way for an <i>afterthought </i>whose advent had been announced, in a rather offhand way, by Rosemary the previous day as she dished out a makeshift lunch of corned-beef sandwiches and orange squash on the lawn.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;Wasn&#x2019;t Olivia the afterthought?&#x2019; Sylvia said to no one in par ticular, and Rosemary frowned at her eldest daughter as if she had just noticed her for the first time. Sylvia, thirteen and until recently an enthusiastic child (many people would have said overenthusiastic), promised to be a mordant cynic in her teenage years. Gawky, be spectacled Sylvia, her teeth recently caged in ugly orthodontic braces, had greasy hair, a hooting laugh and the long, thin fingers and toes of a creature from outer space. Well-meaning people called her an &#x2018;ugly duckling&#x2019; (said to her face, as if it was a compliment, which was certainly not how it was taken by Sylvia), imagining a future Sylvia casting off her braces, acquiring contact lenses and a bosom, and blossoming into a swan. Rosemary did not see the swan in Sylvia, especially when she had a shred of corned beef stuck in her braces. Sylvia had recently developed an unhealthy obsession with religion, claiming that God had spoken to her. Rosemary wondered if it was a normal phase that adolescent girls went through, if God was merely an alternative to pop stars or ponies. Rosemary decided it was best to ignore Sylvia&#x2019;s t�te-�-t�tes with the Almighty. And at least conversations with God were free, whereas the upkeep on a pony would have cost a fortune.<br>&nbsp;<br>And the peculiar fainting fits that their GP said were on account of Sylvia &#x2018;outgrowing her strength&#x2019; &#x2013; a medically dubious explan ation if ever there was one (in Rosemary&#x2019;s opinion). Rosemary decided to ignore the fainting fits as well. They were probably just Sylvia&#x2019;s way of getting attention.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rosemary married their father Victor when she was eighteen years old &#x2013; only five years older than Sylvia was now. The idea that Sylvia might be grown-up enough in five years&#x2019; time to marry anyone struck Rosemary as ridiculous and reinforced her belief that her own parents should have stepped in and stopped her marrying Victor, should have pointed out that she was a mere child and he was a thirty-six-year-old man. She often found herself wanting to remonstrate with her mother and father about their lack of parental care, but her mother had succumbed to stomach cancer not long after Amelia was born and her father had re married and moved to Ipswich, where he spent most of his days in the bookies and all of his evenings in the pub.<br>&nbsp;<br>If, in five years&#x2019; time, Sylvia brought home a thirty-six-year-old, cradle-snatching fianc� (particularly if he claimed to be a great mathematician) then Rosemary thought she would probably cut his heart out with the carving knife. This thought was so agreeable that the <i>afterthought</i>&#x2019;<i>s </i>annunciation was temporarily forgotten and Rosemary allowed them all to run out to the ice-cream van when it declared its own melodic arrival in the street.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Sylvia-Amelia-Julia trio knew that there was no such thing as an <i>afterthought </i>and the &#x2018;foetus&#x2019;, as Sylvia insisted on calling it (she was keen on science subjects), that was making their mother so irritable and lethargic was probably their father&#x2019;s last-ditch attempt to acquire a son. He was not a father who doted on daughters, he showed no real fondness for any of them, only Sylvia occasionally winning his respect because she was &#x2018;good at maths&#x2019;. Victor was a mathematician and lived a rarefied life of the mind where his family were allowed o trespass. This was made easy by the fact that he spent hardly any time with them: he was either in the department or in his rooms in college and when he was home he shut himself in his study, occasionally with his students but usually on his own. Their father had never taken them to the open-air pool on Jesus Green, played rousing games of Snap or Donkey, never tossed them in the air and caught them or pushed them on a swing, had never taken them punting on the river or walking on the Fens or on educational trips to the Fitzwilliam. More like an absence than a presence, everything he was &#x2013; and was not &#x2013; was represented by the sacrosanct space of his study.<br>&nbsp;<br>They would have been surprised to know that the study had once been a bright parlour with a view of the back garden, a room where previous occupants of the house had enjoyed pleasant breakfasts, where women had whiled away the afternoons with sewing and romantic novels, and where in the evenings the family had gathered to play cribbage or Scrabble while listening to a radio play. All of these activities had been envisaged by a newly married Rosemary when the house was first bought &#x2013; in 1956, at a price way beyond their budget &#x2013; but Victor immediately claimed the room as his own and somehow managed to transform it into a sunless place, crammed with heavy bookshelves and ugly oak filing cabinets, and reeking of the untipped Capstans that he smoked. The loss of the room was as nothing to the loss of the way of life that Rosemary had planned to fill it with.<br>&nbsp;<br>What he actually did in there was a mystery to all of them. Something so important, apparently, that his home life was trifling in comparison. Their mother said he was <i>a great mathematician</i>, at work on a piece of research that would one day make him <i>famous</i>, yet on the rare occasions when the study door was left open and they caught a glimpse of their father at work, all he seemed to be doing was sitting at his desk, scowling into empty space.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was not to be disturbed when he was working, especially not by shrieking, screaming, savage little girls. The complete inability of those same savage little girls to abstain from the shrieking and the screaming (not to mention the yelling, the blubbing, and the strange howling like a pack of wolves that Victor had never managed to fathom) made for a fragile relationship between father and daughters.<br>&nbsp;<br>Rosemary&#x2019;s chastisements may have washed over them like water but the sight of Victor lumbering out of his study, roused like a bear from hibernation, was strangely terrifying and although they spent their lives challenging all that was outlawed by their mother, they never once thought of exploring the forbidden interiorof the study. The only time they were ushered into the gloomy depths of Victor&#x2019;s den was for help with their maths homework. This wasn&#x2019;t so bad for Sylvia, who had a fighting chance of understanding the greasy pencil marks with which an impatient Victor covered endless pages of ruled paper, but as far as Julia and Amelia were concerned Victor&#x2019;s signs and symbols were as mysterious as ancient hieroglyphs. If they thought of the study at all, which they tried not to, they thought of it as a torture chamber. Victor blamed Rosemary for their innumeracy &#x2013; it was clearly their mother&#x2019;s deficient female brain they had inherited.<br>&nbsp;<br>Victor&#x2019;s own mother, Ellen, had lent a sweet and balmy presence to his early infancy before being taken off to a lunatic asylum in 1924. Victor was only four at the time and it was judged better for him not to visit his mother in such disturbing quarters, with the result that he grew up imagining her as a raving madwoman of the Victorian variety &#x2013; long white nightdress and wild hair, roaming the corridors of the asylum at night, prattling nonsense like a child &#x2013; and it was only much later in his life that he discovered that his mother had not &#x2018;gone insane&#x2019; (the family&#x2019;s term for it) but had suffered a severe post-partum depression after giving birth to a stillborn baby and neither raved nor prattled but lived sadly and solitarily in a room decorated with photographs of Victor, until she died of tuberculosis when Victor was ten.<br>&nbsp;<br>Oswald, Victor&#x2019;s father, had packed his son off to boarding school by then and when Oswald himself died, accidentally falling into the freezing waters of the Southern Ocean, Victor received the news calmly and returned to the particularly difficult mathematical puzzle he had been working on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Before the war, Victor&#x2019;s father had been that most arcane and useless of English creatures, a polar explorer, and Victor was rather glad that he would no longer have to live up to the heroic image of Oswald Land and could become great in his own, less valiant, field.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Victor met Rosemary when he had to go to the casualty department at Addenbrooke&#x2019;s, where she was a student nurse. He had tripped down some steps and fallen awkwardly on his wrist but he told Rosemary that he&#x2019;d been on his bike when he was &#x2018;cut up&#x2019; by a car on the Newmarket Road. &#x2018;Cut up&#x2019; sounded good to his ears, it was a phrase from a masculine world he&#x2019;d never managed to inhabit successfully (the world of his father), and &#x2018;the Newmarket Road&#x2019; implied (untruthfully) that he didn&#x2019;t spend his whole life cloistered in the limited area between St John&#x2019;s and the maths department.<br>&nbsp;<br>If it hadn&#x2019;t been for this chance hospital encounter, accidental in all senses, Victor might never have courted a girl. He already felt well on his way to middle age and his social life was still limited to the chess club. Victor didn&#x2019;t really feel the need for another person in his life, in fact he found the concept of &#x2018;sharing&#x2019; a life bizarre. He had mathematics, which filled up his time almost completely, so he wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure what he wanted with a wife. Women seemed to him to be in possession of all kinds of un desirable properties, chiefly madness, but also a multiplicity of physical drawbacks &#x2013; blood, sex, children &#x2013; which were unsettling and <i>other</i>. Yet something in him yearned to be surrounded by the kind of activity and warmth so missing in his own childhood, which was how, before he even knew what had happened, like opening the door to the wrong room, he found himself taking tea in a cottage in rural Norfolk while Rosemary shyly displayed a (rather cheap) diamond-chip engagement ring to her parents.<br>&nbsp;<br>Apart from her father&#x2019;s whiskery bedtime benedictions, Victor was the first man Rosemary had ever been kissed by (albeit awkwardly, lunging at her like an elephant seal). Rosemary&#x2019;s father, a railway signalman, and her mother, a housewife, were startled when she brought Victor home to meet them. They were awed by his undoubted intellectual credentials (the black-rimmed spectacles, the shabby sports jacket, the air of permanent distraction), and the possibility that he might even be a bona fide genius (a possibility not exactly refuted by Victor), not to mention the fact that he had chosen their daughter &#x2013; a quiet and easily influenced girl, hitherto overlooked by almost everyone &#x2013; to be his helpmeet.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fact that he was twice Rosemary&#x2019;s age didn&#x2019;t seem to worry them at all, although later, when the happy couple had departed, Rosemary&#x2019;s father, a manly type of man, did point out to his wife that Victor was not &#x2018;a great physical specimen&#x2019;. Rosemary&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s only reservation, however, was that although Victor was a doctor he seemed to have trouble giving her any advice about the stomach pains that she was a martyr to. Cornered at a tea table covered with a Maltese lace cloth and loaded with macaroons, Devon scones and seed cake, Victor finally confirmed, &#x2018;Indigestion, I expect, Mrs Vane,&#x2019; a misdiagnosis that she accepted with relief.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Olivia opened her eyes and stared contentedly at the nursery-rhyme wallpaper. Jack and Jill toiled endlessly up the hill, Jill carrying a wooden bucket for the well she was destined never to reach, while elsewhere on the same hillside Little Bo-Peep was searching for her lost sheep. Olivia wasn&#x2019;t too worried about the fate of the flock because she could see a pretty lamb with a blue ribbon round its neck, hiding behind a hedge. Olivia didn&#x2019;t really understand the <i>afterthought </i>but she would have welcomed a baby. She liked babies and animals better than anything. She could feel the weight of Rascal, the family terrier, near her feet. It was <i>absolutely forbidden </i>for Rascal to sleep in the bedrooms but every night one or other of them smuggled him into their room, although by morni...</p><h2>Knowing The Unknowable God: Ibn Sina, Maimonides, Aquinas</h2><p>In <i>Knowing the Unknowable God</i>, David Burrell traces the intellectual intermingling of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian traditions that made possible the medieval synthesis that served as the basis for Western theology.

He haughtily informs Colleen that she is to bring home her eight year old nephew Joel, who apparently lives in Medora, Dakotah Territory under the care of preacher Jacob Chandler. Taking the train west, Amethyst becomes ill in Minnesota; another passenger tends to her as it is the Christian thing to do. In Medora, she remains somewhat ill; the Hegland family takes her in to their home. Their other guest, Army Major Jeremiah McHenry has just retired from the military and returned to his hometown. As the two guests become acquainted they fall in love, but can Jeremiah persuade the easterner to stay as his wife as he knows she believes she must perform her dad&#39;s task though honoring her father has always been difficult and besides she feels that even the kind former officer would turn female relatives into servants. AMETHYST, the fourth Dakotah Treasures novel, is a superb Americana tale that brings to life a long-gone era due to the strong cast. Amethyst (don&#39;t call her Colleen as only her father uses that name) is a courageous individual who on her journey west meets caring people, a far cry from her verbally abusive father. Jeremiah knows she would make the perfect wife for him because she is a brave nurturing Christian woman whom he loves and believes loves him too, but he must overcome the relational lessons her father taught her.</p><p></p><h2>Spiritual Psychology: The Twelve Primary Life Lessons</h2><p>Have you ever wondered why it is that one person can grow up with every conceivable advantage, and yet seem incapable of mastering even the simplest things in life, or why we seem to repeat destructive behaviors over and over again? <p>Spiritual Psychology explains this and much more from a higher perspective of the human spirit.

Anthony Sutcliffe traces the main features of the development of Parisian building and architecture since Roman times, explaining the interaction of continuity and innovation and relating it to issues of power, the social structure, the property market, fashion, and the creativity of its architects.</p><p>This valuable book summarizes not only the architectural development of Paris over 20 centuries but also much urban and political history as well. Sutcliffe (history, Univ. of Leicester) writes well, and his text falls within the English tradition of such figures as Donald Olsen, Sir John Summerson, and Mark Girouard, who interpret buildings primarily as social and historical documents. Sutcliffe does enthusiastic justice to Paris, long regarded as the most beautiful city in the world, a model of superb architecture and exemplary planning. This is a footnoted, narrative history organized chronologically, as opposed to a guidebook like Norval White's Guide to the Architecture of Paris ( LJ 4/15/92), which is arranged geographically by arrondissement. Recommended for all larger libraries.<br><i>- Peter Kaufman, Boston Coll.</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Featuring 250 illustrations (most in color), this superb architectural history argues that Paris's organic beauty stems from a continuous classical building tradition that has survived the onslaught of functionalist modernism. According to Sutcliffe, a professor of economic and social history at the University of Leicester, England, even Art Nouveau was rejected by the Parisians. It was found inimical to a design tradition that extended from Louis XIV to the Second Empire's modernization program led by architect/planner Georges-Eugene Haussmann to the present. The "machine age" architecture prominent in the 1960s and '70s, as Sutcliffe shows, has been challenged by a new generation of architects emphasizing human scale, tradition and a closer aesthetic relationship between a building and its site. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Ghost of the Mary Celeste: A Novel</h2><p><b>A captivating, atmospheric return to historical fiction that is every bit as convincing and engrossing as Martin's landmark <i>Mary Reilly</i>.</b><br> <br> In 1872 the American merchant vessel <i>Mary Celeste</i> was discovered adrift off the coast of Spain. Her cargo was intact and there was no sign of struggle, but the crew was gone. They were never found.<br> <br> This maritime mystery lies at the center of an intricate narrative branching through the highest levels of late-nineteenth-century literary society. While on a voyage to Africa, a rather hard-up and unproven young writer named Arthur Conan Doyle hears of the <i>Mary Celeste</i> and decides to write an outlandish short story about what took place. This story causes quite a sensation back in the United States, particularly between sought-after Philadelphia spiritualist medium Violet Petra and a rational-minded journalist named Phoebe Grant, who is seeking to expose Petra as a fraud. Then there is the family of the <i>Mary Celeste</i>'s captain, a family linked to the sea for generations and marked repeatedly by tragedy. Each member of this ensemble cast holds a critical piece to the puzzle of the <i>Mary Celeste</i>.<br> <br> These three elements&#x2014;a ship found sailing without a crew, a famous writer on the verge of enormous success, and the rise of an unorthodox and heretical religious fervor&#x2014;converge in unexpected ways, in diaries, in letters, in safe harbors and rough seas. In a haunted, death-obsessed age, a ghost ship appearing in the mist is by turns a provocative mystery, an inspiration to creativity, and a tragic story of the disappearance of a family and of a bond between husband and wife that, for one moment, transcends the impenetrable barrier of death.</p><p><p><b>About the Writing of <i>The Ghost of the Mary Celeste</i>, by Valerie Martin </b></p> <p>I first read about the ghost ship the <i>Mary Celeste</i> when I was in fifth grade &#x2013; I think it must have been an article in the Weekly Reader, the children&#x2019;s newspaper my school subscribed to and which I looked forward to with modest excitement every Friday. I&#x2019;m sure the article barely sketched out the story - a ship sighted drifting at sea in some sort of trouble, with no sailor at the helm; the boarding of the <i>Mary Celeste</i> by the anxious crew of a passing ship; the discovery that there was no one aboard; the evidence that the crew had left on the ship&#x2019;s boat and in a hurry; and the perplexing problem - the mystery - of their motive for abandoning the ship, which was fully provisioned and in seaworthy condition. &#x201c;Fit,&#x201d; as one of the salvers would testify in the salvage hearing at Gibraltar, &#x201c;to sail round the world.&#x201d; </p> <p>A few years ago, by accident and I&#x2019;m still not sure where, I learned that the missing crew of the <i>Mary Celeste</i> included the captain&#x2019;s wife and his baby daughter. This detail caught my attention because I was under the impression that sailors considered women aboard ships bad luck. I began some superficial research about the subject &#x2013; trawling a few nets in the wake of the <i>Mary Celeste</i>, and quickly uncovered a world I&#x2019;d never dreamed of. </p> <p>Throughout the 19th century, women regularly sailed on the vessels that plowed the seas, and it was not uncommon for children to be born aboard ship. Especially on whalers, which would be out at sea for years on end, wives took the opportunity of going along with their husbands. One whaling captain delivered all five of his children on his ship, and some of these learned to walk on a deck before they put their little feet on land. The captain&#x2019;s wife and family were such an ordinary component of seagoing commerce that the sailors had a name for ships with a wife and children in the aft cabin &#x2013; they called them &#x201c;hen frigates.&#x201d; </p> <p>When a captain married, the couple might combine his business with their pleasure and take a honeymoon trip. This was the case with Capt. Benjamin Briggs and his wife Sarah Cobb Briggs, who sailed to Genoa shortly after their marriage in Marion, Massachusetts. In the fall of 1872, Benjamin Briggs purchased a one/fifth interest in a newly fitted ship and signed on to sail her to Messina, a trip that would take about three months. Sarah Briggs, who disliked sailing, decided to join him, taking their two-year-old daughter along. As she wrote to her mother-in-law, &#x201c;Going to sea in itself considered is anything but agreeable, at least to me, but if Benja must go I would gladly go when I could.&#x201d; On October 26, having shipped ahead her melodeon, sewing machine, two boxes of music books, toys, and clothes for herself and her daughter Sophia, she took the train to New York and joined her husband at Pier 8 to board their ship the <i>Mary Celeste</i>. </p> <p>Before long, investigation of the events that followed turned up an unexpected name: Arthur Conan Doyle. </p> <p>The future creator of Sherlock Holmes was a boy when the <i>Mary Celeste</i> was recovered and doubtless followed the news stories about the salvage trial in Gibraltar that appeared in the British and American press. Twelve years later, when he was a struggling young doctor in Edinburgh, Doyle published a story in the <i>Cornhill</i> magazine that purported to be a true account of the lone survivor of the <i>Mary Celeste</i>. Though Doyle altered the name of the ship and changed the captain&#x2019;s name, the public&#x2019;s imagination was fired by this tale and to this day certain details entirely invented by the young Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle, who longed to make his way as a writer, continue to be attached to new accounts, fictional and otherwise, about the famous ghost ship, the <i>Mary Celeste</i>. </p> <p>Even a superficial study of the life of Arthur Conan Doyle bangs up against the 19th century Spiritualist movement, which was spawned in upstate New York and quickly spread across the country and abroad. The craze for mediums, s�ances, spirit writing, spirit photography, spirit guides, table turning, apparitions, and the materialization of ectoplasm excited the interest of a credulous public, as well as an alarming number of prominent and intelligent men and women. Horace Greeley, Alfred Russel Wallace, William James and his brother Henry James, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln and even Queen Victoria indulged in s�ances and clairvoyant lectures. Many of these notables were ultimately disabused of their fascination, but Arthur Conan Doyle became a committed Spiritualist. He gave up writing and spent the last five years of his life traveling the world to spread the good news that life is continuous and that the dead only wait for our attention to make themselves known again. </p> <p>These three elements, a ship found sailing without a crew, a famous writer on the verge of enormous success, and the rise of an unorthodox and heretical religious fervor, began to work in my imagination, and I knew I was on the track of an historical novel. In my researches the fantastic and the banal, the absurd and the tragic seemed woven into an intricate and radiant fabric, one spun from facts and fictions in much the same way everyday life spins out, one story generating another, a thread disappearing in one corner and reappearing surprisingly near the center. </p>VALERIE MARTIN is the author of nine novels, including <i>Trespass</i>, <i>Italian Fever</i>, <i>The Great Divorce</i>, <i>Mary Reilly</i>, and the 2003 Orange Prize-winning <i>Property</i> and of three collections of short fiction.</p><h2>Puppy Too Small</h2><p><p><i> I&#x2019;m too small!&#x201d;</i> wails Puppy every time he sees a doorknob too high to reach, a tree too tall to climb, or a chair too heavy to carry.

This book is a fascinating guide through the vast and varied cultural territory such pilgrimages have covered across the ages. The first book to look at the phenomenon and experience of pilgrimage through the multiple lenses of history, religion, sociology, anthropology, and art history, this sumptuously illustrated volume explores the full richness and range of sacred travel as it maps the cultural imagination. </p><p> The authors consider pilgrimage as a physical journey through time and space, but also as a metaphorical passage resonant with meaning on many levels. It may entail a ritual transformation of the pilgrim's inner state or outer status; it may be a quest for a transcendent goal; it may involve the healing of a physical or spiritual ailment. Through folktales, narratives of the crusades, and the firsthand accounts of those who have made these journeys; through descriptions and pictures of the rituals, holy objects, and sacred architecture they have encountered, as well as the relics and talismans they have carried home, <i>Pilgrimage</i> evokes the physical and spiritual landscape these seekers have traveled. In its structure, the book broadly moves from those religions--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam--that cohere around a single canonical text to those with a multiplicity of sacred scriptures, like Hinduism and Buddhism. Juxtaposing the different practices and experiences of pilgrimage in these contexts, this book reveals the common structures and singular features of sacred travel from ancient times to our own. </p></p><p>Simon Coleman is Lecturer in Anthropology, University of Durham.Coleman and Elsner's study offers irrefutable evidence that humans the world over yearn to connect with that which is held holy in a particular place that is considered holy.<br> --Zachary Karabell (<i>Boston Book Review</i>)<br><br>In tracing sacred travels from fifth-century B.C.E.

Born on October 28, 1919, she received a B.S. in home economics from Winthrop College in Rock Hill, South Carolina, an M.S. in foods and nutrition from the University of North Carolina&#x2013;Greensboro, and a doctorate in administration from Columbia University, New York City.<br> After serving as a nutritionist with the Ohio Health Department, a member of the Foods and Nutrition faculty at Purdue University, and the Head of Foods and Nutrition at the University of Nevada, Dr. Swope took early retirement to begin a new ministry, Nutrition with a Mission. Through lectures and seminars, she encouraged audiences to deny themselves unneeded calories, save the money the calories would have cost, and give it to Great Commission programs and projects.<br> Dr. Swope made many TV appearances on shows such as <i>The 700 Club</i> on the Christian Broadcasting Network.</p><h2>The Sarong and the Kris</h2><p>DJ is generally clean and is complete but it does have a couple of small tears to edges.

The efforts of Henry Hardy to edit Berlin's work and reintroduce it to a broad, eager readership have gone far to remedy this. Now, Princeton is pleased to return to print, under one cover, Berlin's essays on Vico, Hamann, and Herder. These essays on three relatively uncelebrated thinkers are not marginal ruminations, but rather among Berlin's most important studies in the history of ideas. They are integral to his central project: the critical recovery of the ideas of the Counter-Enlightenment and the explanation of its appeal and consequences--both positive and (often) tragic.</p><br><p> Giambattista Vico was the anachronistic and impoverished Neapolitan philosopher sometimes credited with founding the human sciences. He opposed Enlightenment methods as cold and fallacious. J. G. Hamann was a pious, cranky dilettante in a peripheral German city. But he was brilliant enough to gain the audience of Kant, Goethe, and Moses Mendelssohn. In Hamann's chaotic and long-ignored writings, Berlin finds the first strong attack on Enlightenment rationalism and a wholly original source of the coming swell of romanticism. Johann Gottfried Herder, the progenitor of populism and European nationalism, rejected universalism and rationalism but championed cultural pluralism.</p><br><p> Individually, these fascinating intellectual biographies reveal Berlin's own great intelligence, learning, and generosity, as well as the passionate genius of his subjects. Together, they constitute an arresting interpretation of romanticism's precursors. In Hamann's railings and the more considered writings of Vico and Herder, Berlin finds critics of the Enlightenment worthy of our careful attention. But he identifies much that is misguided in their rejection of universal values, rationalism, and science. With his customary emphasis on the frightening power of ideas, Berlin traces much of the next centuries' irrationalism and suffering to the historicism and particularism they advocated. What Berlin has to say about these long-dead thinkers--in appreciation and dissent--is remarkably timely in a day when Enlightenment beliefs are being challenged not just by academics but by politicians and by powerful nationalist and fundamentalist movements.</p><br><p> The study of J. G. Hamann was originally published under the title <i>The Magus of the North: J. G. Hamann and the Origins of Modern Irrationalism</i>. The essays on Vico and Herder were originally published as <i>Vico and Herder: Two Studies in the History of Ideas</i>. Both are out of print.</p></p><p><p>"Isaiah Berlin's main preoccupation throughout his productive life was understand the nature of the modern reaction against the Enlightenment. These essays on Vico, Herder, and Hamann belong with his other profound and influential studies of the leading figures of what he called the Counter-Enlightenment. But they are also crucial for anyone hoping to understand Berlin's own analysis of modern life and politics, which has received increasing attention in recent years. Anyone interested in Berlin or those he studied will find this an essential volume."<b>--Mark Lilla, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"Isaiah Berlin is among the finest intellectual historians of recent decades. Yet his position is somewhat peculiar: for while he is clearly a scholar of enormous erudition, the characteristic style of his work is closer to that of brilliant conversation than of conventional historical scholarship. His works on Vico, Herder, and Hamann deal with thinkers who were at odds with main currents of the Enlightenment. For anyone with a historical sense, the recrudescence of so many of the characteristic notions of the 'Counter-Enlightenment' under the rubric of 'postmodernism' is striking. The recovery of these ideas is all the more effective for being a critical one: Berlin reminds his readers of some of the unfortunate historical consequences of the ideas in question."<b>--Jerry Z. Muller, Catholic University of America</b></p><b>Isaiah Berlin</b> was, until his death in 1997, a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. He was renowned as an essayist and as the author of many books, among them <i>Karl Marx, Four Essays on Liberty, Russian Thinkers, The Sense of Reality, The Proper Study of Mankind,</i> and from Princeton, <i>Concepts and Categories, Personal Impressions, The Crooked Timber of Humanity, The Roots of Romanticism, The Power of Ideas,</i> and <i>Three Critics of the Enlightenment</i>. <b>Henry Hardy</b>, a Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford, is one of Isaiah Berlin's literary trustees.

About one in three of America's professional officers chose to serve the Confederacy, and the government's urgent need to find commanders for its vastly expanded army put stars on the shoulders of men of very varied backgrounds and talents. The trials of war would soon separate the born leaders from the over-promoted and the political opportunists. This second volume devoted to Union generals examines the careers and personalities of 25 commanders whose service was mainly, or at first, in the Western theater of war.</p><p>An unrivalled illustrated reference source on fighting men and commanders, past and present.

In 1754, the French-Indian War broke out as a decisive battle between the French and British for control of North America. Britain&#39;s victory led to greater governmental involvement in the American colonies that developed into rebellion in 1775. Following the American Revolution, the USA and Britain shared an uneasy peace that erupted in war again in 1812; the ensuing conflict tore through the American frontier. This book examines the wars in North America from the French-Indian War until the end of the War of 1812, which brought lasting peace between Britain and the United States.</p><p>Daniel Marston is Senior Lecturer at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, UK.

Marshall and Chief Justice Earl Warren. He lives in Los Angeles and is professor of journalism at the University of Southern California.The biographer of Gen. George C. Marshall (General of the Army) turns his prodigious skills to view another complex American hero with an equally complex story-folk singer and political activist Woody Guthrie. Cray's access to thousands of pages from the Woody Guthrie Archives (including previously unpublished letters, diaries and journals) allows him to present a comprehensive picture, although sometimes the detail keeps Cray from moving the story along. However, this is the definitive biography of a songwriter whose legendary image for the past half-century has been "the banty, brilliant songwriter who had stood up for the underdog and downtrodden." Cray provides a superb look at Guthrie's background as a real estate agent's son. He carefully details how Guthrie moved from a fairly conventional career in country music to a recreation of his image through remarkable songs, like his "Dust Bowl Ballads,'' and gained a whole new Depression-era audience: "The Okies and Arkies, the Texicans and Jayhawkers, had become Woody's people." Cray also expertly observes how the "writerly discipline" of these works was missing in his post-WWII songs. While Guthrie's folk hero status is a given today, Cray shows just how much effort it actually took for a new generation of folk singers such as Bob Dylan to raise awareness of Guthrie's importance as the man himself fell victim to Huntington's disease. Finally, Cray fully explores one of the real heroes in this story, Guthrie's second wife, Marjorie, who stuck with the singer during and after their stormy marriage. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The British tried erecting fences and posting guards to keep the monkeys back, but eventually decided to play the ball where the monkey dropped it -- as we often must do in life, to live as best we can with forces that are beyond our control.</p><p>Why must we suffer? Gregory Knox Jones tackles this enduring issue of life with clarity and intelligence, offering hope to anyone who is struggling with the pain and confusion of unjust suffering. Dr. Jones recounts the life stories he has seen in his work as a pastor: parents losing their child in a car accident, a runner coping with the amputation of his leg. Every day good people suffer, raising the question: Why is this so, if there is a just and all-powerful God? The response that God works in mysterious ways that are beyond human understanding simply isn't adequate in the face of such profound suffering. Dr. Jones, who has more than twenty years' experience in the parish, found that he had to rethink his ideas as he ministered to people in pain and grief. The wisdom that he gained enabled him to lead people through the most difficult circumstances to healing and new hope.</p><p>Now, in <em>Play the Ball Where the Monkey Drops It,</em> Jones gently guides us through the inadequacies of the traditional solutions to the problem of evil, offering practical and compassionate answers to the deepest questions rooted in the experience of everyday life. Notable for its relevant real-life examples and its clarity, this book offers guidance and solace to anyone who has ever wondered, "Why me?"</p></p><p><p>Dr. Gregory Knox Jones is a descendant of John Knox, who founded the Presbyterian Church in Scotland.

But the arrival of Rocking Napier, shortly to be separated from his wife, gives Mildred some pause for thought. Diverted by her amusing and unconventional new lodgers downstairs, the quest for bachelor vicar Julian Malory is almost forgotten.</p></p><p>An unqualifiedly great novel from the writer most likely to be compared to Jane Austen, this is a very funny, perfectly written book that can rival any other in its ability to capture the essence of its characters on the page. Mildred Lathbury, the narrator of Pym&#39;s excellent book is a never-married woman in her 30s--which in 1950s England makes her a nearly-confirmed spinster. Hers is a pretty unexciting life, centered around her small church, and part-time job. But Mildred is far more perceptive and witty than even she seems to think, and when Helena and Rockingham Napier move into the flat below her, there seems to be a chance for her life to take a new direction.<b>Barbara Pym</b> (1913 - 1980) was an English novelist whose comedy-of-manners novels of village life looked deeply at the relationships between men and women. Her <i>Quartet in Autumn</i> was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.</p><h2>The Birthday</h2><p>Confident that she was the dominant member of her family, and the one to whom the others were bound by ties of love and loyalty, Meriel Graham expected that on her birthday it would, as usual, be everyone&#39;s concern to give her pleasure. However, under the normal surface of the day, all were occupied with problems of their own, so that the anniversary was remembered only by accident. At the end of the day&#39;s surprises, faced with revelations which, if acknowledged, could result in the loss of her prized security, Meriel shrinks from self-recognition. It is Peter, her husband, who, after all the unhappiness her obtuseness has caused, is determined that in future she will not dictate the manner of their lives.</p><p>Born in Surrey, England, to John and Alison Larminie in 1924, Margaret Yorke (Margaret Beda Nicholson) grew up in Dublin before moving back to England in 1937, where the family settled in Hampshire, although she now lives in a small village in Buckinghamshire. During World War II she saw service in the Women&#39;s Royal Naval Service as a driver. In 1945, she married, but it was only to last some ten years, although there were two children; a son and daughter. Her childhood interest in literature was re-enforced by five years living close to Stratford-upon-Avon and she also worked variously as a bookseller and as a librarian in two Oxford Colleges, being the first woman ever to work in that of Christ Church. She is widely travelled and has a particular interest in both Greece and Russia. Her first novel was published in 1957, but it was not until 1970 that she turned her hand to crime writing. There followed a series of five novels featuring Dr. Patrick Grant, an Oxford don and amateur sleuth, who shares her own love of Shakespeare. More crime and mystery was to follow, and she has written some forty three books in all, but the Grant novels were limited to five as, in her own words, &#39;authors using a series detective are trapped by their series. It stops some of them from expanding as writers&#39;. She is proud of the fact that many of her novels are essentially about ordinary people who find themselves in extraordinary situations which may threatening, or simply horrific. It is this facet of her writing that ensures a loyal following amongst readers who inevitably identify with some of the characters and recognise conflicts that may occur in everyday life. Indeed, she states that characters are far more important to her than intricate plots and that when writing &#39;I don&#39;t manipulate the characters, they manipulate me&#39;. Critics have noted that she has a &#39;marvellous use of language&#39; and she has frequently been cited as an equal to P.D. James and Ruth Rendell. She is a past chairman of the Crime Writers&#39; Association and in 1999 was awarded the Cartier Diamond Dagger, having already been honoured with the Martin Beck Award from the Swedish Academy of Detection.</p><h2>Instant American History</h2><p>A clever compendium of information is presented in an entertaining manner for history buffs and those who just want to brush up on the facts, citing the important events and including sidebars such as &#34;Who&#39;s Who&#34; and &#34;Behind the Scenes.&#34; Original.</p><p>st Asian migration across the Bering Strait to Sherman&#39;s famous march to the sea, this visually engaging book gives you everything you really need to know about American history from Independence to Reconstruction.

Did you know that <i>Oy!</i> is not a word, but a vocabulary with 29 distinct variations, sighed, cried, howled, or moaned, employed to express anything from ecstasy to horror? Here are words heard 'round the English-speaking world: chutzpa, or gall, brazen nerve, effrontery, "...that quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and his father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan."

In Weekend, the Mathnet detectives are invited to participate in a murder-mystery overnight. When their fellow guests begin disappearing, it seems at first to be part of the play. Then the Mathnetters discover that they are at the wrong house and realize that a real crime is taking place. The Smart Dummy, Charlie, belongs to a ventriloquist who has gone into shock over the loss of his second puppet. Its case was apparently switched for a suitcase containing one million dollars in counterfeit money. The human performer refuses to talk, so the detectives must communicate with Charlie to recover the missing dummy and apprehend the criminals. Both cases require the use of mathematical logic. The clues are well presented and the solution process is clearly explained. The writing style perfectly mirrors the old Dragnet shows, complete with DUM DE DUM DUM to mark climactic points! Many of the punning references are beyond the intended audience, but the broad humor and mock-serious dialogue will appeal to many readers.

Lifted out of context, these chapters describe both the policewomen of the precinct and the wives and lovers of the men on the force. Starting when Detective Carella meets and woos the beautiful deaf-mute Teddy (Cop Hater, 1956), other extracts dwell upon the Carellas as the ideal spouses, parents and lovers. Later, the focus is on handsome but amorously luckless Detective Kling. Before he can marry brainy and lovely Claire Townsend, she's shot dead by a mass murderer. Then quarrelsome Cindy Forest breaks their engagement and the officer's heart again. During the following years, Kling finally weds, expecting eternal bliss with the gorgeous model Augusta Blair; she, however, winds up in bed with a writer of TV commercials. In the collection's only partially rewarding entries, the precinct's Officer Eileen Burke earns a promotion as a decoy on the rape squad (The Mugger, 1968, through Lightning, 1984). Burke's career is a good example of the realism and fearful tensions that McBain invariably creates; in addition, one could suppose courageous Officer Burke is his bow to feminism. Given the attraction between her and Kling, however, she might be his last chance at living happily ever after. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Home of Her Own</h2><p>A Home of Her Own by Brenda Novak released on Nov 24, 2004 is available now for purchase.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Brenda Novak has written over 60 novels.

Acting Detective William Murdoch pulled his astrakhan hat tighter over his ears, thrust his bare hands deep into his pockets, and shoulders hunched against the cold driving rain, plodded up Ontario Street toward the police station. Pain from an infected tooth had sent him from his bed, and in an attempt to distract himself, he had dressed and set out for work well ahead of his duty time.<br>&nbsp;<br>He turned onto Wilton just as a cab was going by and stepped back to avoid being splashed. The cabbie slowed his horse in case Murdoch was a potential fare, realised he wasn&#x2019;t, and tipped his whip in acknowledgment as he passed by. He was wrapped in a voluminous black oiled slicker, the high collar masking his lower face and the hood pulled down so low over his forehead that only his eyes were visible. The horse had no such protection and its coat was dark from the rain. Like a lot of cab horses, the beast looked underfed, as if it had barely a trot left in it, but the driver snapped the reins and they heaved into a faster clip. Murdoch watched the rear lamp swaying, warm and bright in the gloom, until the carriage turned south on Parliament, leaving him alone on the dark street.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>What if I am the last man on the earth? he thought. What if I&#x2019;m really dead and in purgatory? Is this what it is? </i>Physical pain and loneliness melding together until he couldn&#x2019;t separate one from the other. Suddenly, somebody, probably a servant, lit a lamp in the upstairs room of one of the houses he was passing and the light winked out through a crack in the curtain. Murdoch was somewhat embarrassed at the relief he felt and he grinned at his own nonsense. He shook his head to clear out the morbid thoughts and was rewarded by a current of white-hot pain along his jaw, so severe he yelped. Trying to move cautiously to avoid aggravating matters, he continued on his way. He was heartily glad to reach the steps of the station. The outside lamp was burning and the windows were bright.<br>&nbsp;<br>He pushed open the door, greeted by the familiar smell of woodstove, sawdust, and a lingering sourness from the old clothes and unwashed bodies of the local constituents. The fourth division served Toronto from the working-class streets of River and Sackville in the east, to the nobs who lived in grand houses on Jarvis and Church streets in the west. The east-siders were the ones whose backsides polished the wooden benches in the station hall.<br>&nbsp;<br>The night-duty sergeant, Gardiner, was seated on a high stool behind the counter, entering his report in the register. He glanced up in surprise to see Murdoch.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Gawdelpus, you&#x2019;re the early bird.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The detective grunted, not feeling up to a long-winded explanation. His tooth had started hurting about a week ago, but he&#x2019;d managed to ignore it until yesterday, when the pain had worsened. His landlady, Mrs. Kitchen, sent him to bed with a brown paper and vinegar poultice to hold to his face and had padded his gum with some cotton wool soaked in carbolic. That had helped for a while, but at five o&#x2019;clock he had been dragged to consciousness with the sensation that every nerve in his body had gathered at a point on his lower jaw and was pulsing there.<br>&nbsp;<br>He took off his fur hat and shook the rain out of it.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; asked the sergeant.<br>&nbsp;<br>Gardiner was regarding him curiously and Murdoch knew he must look like a pauper&#x2019;s pal.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Got a toothache,&#x201d; he mumbled. He tried to talk without moving his mouth very much.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Awful things them toothaches. Keep you up, don&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch blinked in agreement.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Better get yourself into the dentist. There&#x2019;s a fellow right at the corner. You could drop in on him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch grunted. Not if he could help it. George Crabtree had been forced to visit Dr. Brodie last year and, big and tough as a moose though he might be, the constable had almost fainted when he staggered out of the chair. His face was swollen for weeks.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My landlady&#x2019;s good,&#x201d; said Murdoch. &#x201c;Knows a lot . . . carbolic . . . &#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Wondered what it was I could smell. Helped, did it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hm.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The sergeant sniffed. &#x201c;Or is it fish? Did the cat bring something in?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch shrugged. The smell was from his sealskin coat, which developed a distinctive odour when it was wet. He&#x2019;d got it from an old lag a couple of years ago, in exchange for some tobacco, and he considered it a good bargain in spite of the pong.<br>&nbsp;<br>He started to head for the sanctuary of his office, which was a tiny cubicle across from the cells.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;While you&#x2019;re over there, put some more coal in, will you?&#x201d; called out Gardiner.<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch opened the stove door, picked up a pair of tongs, seized a large piece of coal and dropped it into the red maw. The action hurt.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a waft of chill air as the hall door opened and Ed Hales, the patrol sergeant, came in. He hung<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Perishing cold out there.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing to what it will be,&#x201d; said Gardiner. &#x201c;Wait till we get winter.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re early this morning, Will.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got toothache,&#x201d; Gardiner answered for him. &#x201c;Kept him up. He&#x2019;s going to have to have it pulled.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hey, I don&#x2019;t know that yet,&#x201d; protested Murdoch.<br>&nbsp;<br>The sergeant grinned at him. &#x201c;That kind of pain means abscess. If you don&#x2019;t look after it you could be in bad trouble. Second cousin of the wife&#x2019;s nearly died from an abscess. Poison got into her blood. She was bad for months after, still not right. It affected her mentally. She cries all the time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Glad to know that, Gardiner. Lifted my spirits no end did that little tale.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The duty sergeant shrugged, undaunted. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the truth, I tell you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How about I brew up a pot of tea, Will?&#x201d; interjected Hales. &#x201c;Cheer us both up. Come on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch was about to refuse but Hales, out of sight of the duty sergeant, nodded warningly. He had something to say.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t mind a mug myself,&#x201d; Gardiner called after them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m parched.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch followed Hales through to the small back room where the officers ate their meals. The morning shift hadn&#x2019;t arrived yet and the fire was low in the grate, the room chilly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t I look after the pot and you see to the fire; you&#x2019;re better at it than me,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Hales but he didn&#x2019;t move. He pulled at the ends of his moustache. He was a tall man, ruddy-faced. He was invariably pleasant and even-tempered, qualities that made him popular in the station, but this morning he was visibly distressed.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Need your ear a minute, Will . . . I didn&#x2019;t want to say anything in front of Gardiner, he&#x2019;s got a sniffer for trouble like a rat on offal but,&#x201d; he hesitated, reluctant to admit the bad news, &#x201c;fact is, young Wicken seems to have gone missing.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Missing?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, he don&#x2019;t seem to be on his beat.&#x201d; He rubbed at his moustache. &#x201c;I did my first check on him at twenty-five minutes past eight. All correct. Did the second at a quarter past ten like normal. Again all correct. But when I went to check in on him at a quarter past two, he was nowhere to be seen. Supposed to be up at River and Gerrard. I thought maybe he&#x2019;d stepped into a laneway to have a piss, even though he shouldn&#x2019;t, and I waited a bit. No sign of him. I walked back along Gerrard. Not a whisker. I put pebbles on the doorknobs. You know that little trick.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch nodded. The constable on the beat was supposed to check the doors of the vacant houses to make sure they were secure, no vagrants camping out. The patrol sergeant sometimes tested the officers with a small stone or piece of dirt. If it was still there at the next round, heaven help the constable on duty.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;When he wasn&#x2019;t at the four o&#x2019;clock checkpoint, I walked his entire beat in reverse but he was nowhere to be seen. All of the pebbles were still there.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch frowned. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s bloody strange. Is he playing up, d&#x2019;you think? Hiding?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The younger constables sometimes teased the good-natured patrol sergeant by hiding out until he went by, then innocently meeting him on the return route. It was childish but it relieved the boredom. Murdoch had done it himself when he was on the beat.<br>&nbsp;<br>Hales shook his head. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s never done it before and it&#x2019;s past a joke by now. If he isn&#x2019;t here at changeover he could be put on a charge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Ill then? Could he have been taken ill? Gone home?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Even as he said it, Murdoch knew how unlikely that was. Wicken would have gone to the closest alarm box and telephoned in to headquarters.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He looked healthy as a doctor when I saw him last. He wasn&#x2019;t drunk neither.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The two men looked at each other, mirroring each other&#x2019;s uneasiness.<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch reached for his hat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go and have another gander. You&#x2019;ve got your report to do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Thanks, Will. If he is just acting batchy, I&#x2019;ll overlook it as long as he&#x2019;s back on the beat when the next shift comes in. But if he&#x2019;s not there without a damn good reason, it&#x2019;ll be dire.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Where should he be right now?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Coming down River Street from Gerrard. Maybe you could try going the reverse way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch stood up. &#x201c;Save me some tea.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The whole pot if you find him safe,&#x201d; said Hales. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;d better take my lamp. But don&#x2019;t let Gardiner see you if you can help it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch went back to the hall. He managed to whip the lantern off the hook while the duty sergeant was turned away, getting a file from the cabinet. However, Gardiner saw him at the door.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my tea? What are you doing, growing it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hales&#x2019;s doing it,&#x201d; muttered Murdoch. &#x201c;Got-tuh go.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The sergeant called after him. &#x201c;Have them all pulled out. You&#x2019;ll be better off in the long run.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch waved his hand.<br>&nbsp;<br>Outside, dawn was coming in begrudgingly and the rain had slowed to a drizzle. He set off at as fast a pace as he could manage, heading east along Wilton to River Street. Even though moving quickly caused the pain to pulse through to his eye socket, he felt the need to hurry. He couldn&#x2019;t imagine why the young constable wasn&#x2019;t on his beat. No one with a brain in his head would take a joke this far and risk losing his job. That left the possibility that something had happened to him and that wasn&#x2019;t good either.<br>&nbsp;<br>River Street wasn&#x2019;t as heavily populated as the other streets in the division and there were several vacant lots. They reminded him of missing teeth, a gap between molars. Quickly, he checked the doors of the houses that were boarded up. On each knob was balanced a small pebble. Wicken&#x2019;s beat started at the corner of Parliament Street and Gerrard and would have taken him in an easterly direction toward River Street, where he turned south to Queen, back west, then north again up Parliament. During the long night, he walked this square many times, making sure all the God-fearing were safe in their beds. If he had the bad luck to miss any criminal occurrence, such as a break-in, he was held accountable. As far as the chief constable, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Grasett, was concerned, a crime meant the constable on the beat was remiss in his duty and he was always reprimanded.<br>&nbsp;<br>Murdoch turned left onto Gerrard and paused, looking down the deserted street. More lamps were showing in the houses now, welcome smudges of light. If the constable had run into any kind of trouble, it had been silent. No one had raised an alarm.<br>&nbsp;<br>He continued to Parliament Street, past Toronto General and the Burnside lying-in hospital on the north side of Gerrard. <i>Even as I&#x2019;m going by, an infant might be squawling its first cry</i>. His mind skittered away from the thought because that led straight to Liza, and what they had hoped for. <i>Four children, Will, and then we&#x2019;ll see. I&#x2019;m not going to be one of those women whose job in life is to be a breeding mare. </i>Murdoch sighed. <i>Fat lot of good all that nattering did us. There won&#x2019;t be any at all now</i>. The memory of her sudden death from typhoid fever, two years ago, was still a cause for anguish.<br>&nbsp;<br>He forced himself to focus on what he was doing. Across from the hospital grounds was the medical school. Quite a lot of lights burning there. It took him about fifteen minutes to reach Parliament Street but there was absolutely no sign of Wicken. He stopped for a moment until the throbbing in his jaw subsided. On the southeast corner there was another vacant house. It had once been quite grand, but now the windows were boarded up and the front fence was protecting only weeds, colourless and drooping. He squeezed by the stiff iron gate and walked down the path to the front door. Shrubs, heavy with raindrops, brushed against him as he went up a short flight of steps into a deeply recessed porch. Hales&#x2019;s pebble was where he&#x2019;d put it. Murdoch knocked it off, turned the doorknob and shoved. The door had lost much of its paint but was solid wood and it didn&#x2019;t yield. He stepped back, fished out a box of matches from his pocket, and lit the dark lantern. The bull&#x2019;s-eye beam was bright and strong and he directed it at the windows. They too looked intact, no sign of breakage.<br>&nbsp;<br>There was a flagged path that branched off to the rear of the house and, pushing his way through the long grass that had overgrown it, Murdoch tramped around to a high gate that opened into a walled garden. This was neglected and overgrown, but like the house, suggested a former grandeur. To his right was a patio with a fancy design of yellow and red brick. He walked over to the back door. Around the lintel there was a climbing rosebush, two or three frostbitten buds still on their stems. An image of the church window, Christ&#x2019;s blood on the thorns, jumped into his mind, taking him by surprise with its intensity.<br>&nbsp;<br>He turned the handle and the door opened easily. He stepped inside.<br>&nbsp;<br>The light shone on Wicken&#x2019;s body.<br>&nbsp;<br>He was lying on his left side, facing the door; his head was uncovered and surrounded by a halo of blood, which had soaked much of his blond hair. His legs were crossed at the ankles and between his thighs was wedged his revolver, barrel uppermost, stiff and protruding like a grotesque symbol of manhood.</p><h2>Decoding Advertisements (Ideas in Progress)</h2><p>A fascinating account of how the admen achieve their effects.?Stuart Hood<br><br>This book sets out not simply to criticize advertisements on the grounds of dishonesty and exploitation, but to examine in detail, through over a hundred illustrations, their undoubted attractiveness and appeal. The overt economic function of this appeal is to make us buy things.

He is the author of the phenomenally successful Island, Dive and Everest trilogies, the ever-popular Macdonald Hall series and the popular On the Run series. Korman likes to travel and visit students all over North America.Grade 7-10 This zany, but rather pointless, romp pits Simon Irving against his father, vice-president of Interflux corporation, to save a piece of open land next to his high school. While masquerading as contemporary high-school angst, this novel is pure fantasy bordering on the ridiculous at points. Although there are some funny moments at school and passable character development of Simon and his two best friends, girls and women are reduced to cardboard stupidity or, worse yet, clinging boyfriend fiends. Simon's mother is a culinary fool who follows every whimsical new "health" diet that the newspaper prints. She is the continual target of the longest standing joke in the book. The ending, true to form, depends on the absurd antics of another adult, this time Simon's father's boss, to resolve the dilemma of students fighting the insensitive corporation. Thus, the story ends even more pointlessly than it began. It's easy to pass this one by.

Tell Me Everything</i> is her first novel.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>Freshman Year<br><br>Those first weeks at Hawthorne appear in my mind as books might sit on a shelf, neat and ordered, separated by genre. I wonder if the others remember it as I do. Bits and pieces of memories, scattered moments, things we said, things we did. The reasons we became so close; it came down to those first few days, insecurities and nerves unifying us as one.<br><br>After my parents hauled my belongings into my bare room and escorted me to the dining hall, I was alone. I knew nobody, and I lived in a single in a dorm. It reminded me of the first day of kindergarten. My mother had dropped me off, her scent still lingering in the air after she left. She wore a perfume that defined parts of my childhood, every memory laced with that fragrance. I sat at one of the miniature communal tables, quiet and calm, while my peers panicked, cried and screamed, threw tantrums. College was similar, minus the show. Everyone older now, capable of hiding their fear&#x2014;�but the pits of their stomachs gnawed at them, and I saw the same panic in their eyes. They wondered if they would make friends, if they would find a place to belong for the next four years of life.<br><br>I looked up at the shiny new dining hall, construction having barely finished over the summer, its glass walls reflecting warm light in my eyes. Posters taped to the outside promoting campus clubs and athletic events. I thought about my parents, who would be crossing the Maine&#x2013;�New Hampshire border, driving the speed limit down Interstate 95 toward the airport in Boston. My mother was probably staring out the window as my father drove, watching the trees pass by, wondering when they would begin to turn.<br><br>I met John first, before anyone else came into my life at Hawthorne. Everyone pegged me as Ruby&#x2019;s best friend, her sidekick from day one. I didn&#x2019;t argue otherwise. Besides, people were drawn to Ruby, her bouncy ponytail of chestnut hair and enduring smile attracting the attention, not me. Everyone wanted to be close to that kind of perfection. People assumed she plucked me from the crowd of girls willing to be her friend when, in actuality, I chose her.<br><br>The dining hall was packed with new students, and a few jostled by as they made their way to empty seats. I stood still, eyeing my options. Students were introducing themselves, talking about their summers. I didn&#x2019;t have to choose a seat quite yet. The talk would start in ten minutes. I could grab a coffee from the cart outside. I turned on my heels and left, relieved for open space and fresh air.<br><br>&#x201c;Iced coffee,&#x201d; I said to the barista behind the cart. She looked older, maybe this was her campus job. A junior perhaps. &#x201c;Black, please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Same,&#x201d; said a voice from behind me. I glanced over my shoulder, looking up to see the face that belonged to the voice. It was rare for me to feel short.<br><br>Clear blue eyes stared down at me. He smiled, one of those half-�smiles, charming and quirky, and had a handsome face, with thick blond hair sticking out from underneath his hat. I looked back at the barista, perhaps a little too fast. She stared at him, too, until he cleared his throat and she handed us both the coffees.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s on me,&#x201d; he said. Before I could protest, he had already handed over four dollars.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, um,&#x201d; I mumbled. &#x201c;Thanks. That was really not necessary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No prob,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Keep your friends close, enemies closer, right?&#x201d;<br><br>I looked at him, confused. His mouth curved into a sly smile.<br><br>&#x201c;The sticker,&#x201d; he said, pointing at something on my book bag. &#x201c;Texans?&#x201d; He pointed to his brimmed hat. &#x201c;Giants guy.&#x201d;<br><br>I looked down at my bag. My dad had smacked the sticker on my bag after the Texans won two games in a row last winter. It was a big deal because they usually lost, by a lot. My dad was so excited, his face like a little kid&#x2019;s. I hadn&#x2019;t seen him like that since I was young, so I didn&#x2019;t take the sticker off, in fear of his face falling back into that grief.<br><br>&#x201c;Right. Go Texans,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re much of a threat, though.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, you never know, with some good draft picks,&#x201d; he replied with a wink.<br><br>He spoke in that relaxed, teenage-�guy kind of way. Dopey and sweet. I smiled a little, hoping to seem grateful and pleasant. But �really, I was annoyed. I hated being indebted to people. Especially guys like this, who I knew would give me some pet name and high-�five me whenever he saw me, or hold out his fist for a bump, leaving me guessing which one he would choose. I&#x2019;d rather buy my own coffee.<br><br>He held the door to the dining hall open for me, and I slipped inside, eager to get away so we didn&#x2019;t have to talk.<br><br>&#x201c;John,&#x201d; someone called from the path outside, and John the Giants fan released the door and let it close between us, already giving the other guy a loose handshake and slap on the back. They looked like athletes, the way their bodies moved with grace and precision, despite the slight air of nonchalance they both carried in their shoulders. Tan lines on their shins. Soccer, I guessed.<br><br>I got in line for my orientation packet and watched them through the glass. I wondered if they had just met, or if there was a preseason, or if they knew each other from home. It was curious watching people interact, watching them decide what to say, how to act. Their first impression the most important. I noted their body language, the attempts to look carefree. I tried to relax my shoulders, but they were stuck in permanent intensity.<br><br>John and I locked eyes, his mouth curling into that suggestive smile I would see a thousand times. He gave me a wink, and I turned fast, pretending not to see. I preferred to go unnoticed, but I had inherited my mother&#x2019;s porcelain fair skin and green eyes. My facial features were symmetrical and soft, and no matter how much I ate, my body remained thin. The Texan sun spun my hair gold, despite my urge to be plain and anonymous.<br><br>I turned my head away, but I could still feel his eyes on me, taking me in. His laughter rumbled as the glass doors opened and closed for other students.<br><br>There was a familiarity about him&#x2014;�in the way he smiled, how he wanted to do something nice for me, the coloring of his skin and hair. I swallowed and forced the memory to pass.</p><h2>HOW TO WRITE KILLER FICTION</h2><p>Presents a guide to crafting mystery and suspense stories, defining the difference between the two genres and offering tips on subtly dispensing clues, constructing story arcs, and understanding the fundamentals of composition.</p><p>*Starred Review* Here, for writers itching to get started (but not quite sure how), is one of the most useful recent guides to crafting words into stories. The author, whose mystery fiction has won a handful of awards, customizes her guide for writers of detective fiction and suspense (although her discussions of plotting and character creation will be valuable to all would-be scribblers, regardless of their chosen genre). Wheat begins with an insightful discussion of the distinction between mystery and suspense--each plays to a different part of the reader's imagination and expectations--and then devotes a section to each genre. She offers up plenty of useful tips, such as how to dispense vital information in subtle ways and how to plant clues without being too obvious about it. Where the book really scores, however, is in Wheat's demonstration of how to construct a novel as a series of arcs, each designed to take the reader gracefully to a certain point in the story. While covering similar territory, the sections on mystery and suspense approach the material from slightly different angles. The final section, on the writing process, provides a nuts-and-bolts discussion of such fundamentals as outlining, revising, and finding the right voice for your story. There are almost as many writer's guides on the market as there are struggling writers, but this one is indispensable. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They have three ongoing mystery series, the <i>Sister Agatha</i> series, starring a cloistered nun, the <i>Lee Nez</i> series, featuring a Navajo vampire who teams up with a female FBI agent to fight crimes that have elements of the supernatural, and their flagship series, the critically-acclaimed <i>Ella Clah</i> novels. Several Ella Clah novels, including T<i>racking Bear, Red Mesa,</i> and <i>Shooting Chant</i>, have received starred reviews from Booklist. <br><br>David Thurlo was raised on the Navajo Indian Reservation and later taught school in Shiprock, also on the Rez.

They have written more than fifty novels which have been published in more than twenty countries.<br>ONE<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Yesterday's "garbage bomb" and Charlie's near-death had made the evening news, even on Albuquerque TV, and more video had aired of the burning Dumpster and shattered cinder-block wall than of Ella's and Mary Lou's success with Charlie. For some reason any event with fire footage usually made the lead story on the TV news. The photo that had run in the newspaper, unfortunately, was one showing her lying flat on her face with the burning trash in the background.<br>Since the incident, she'd received thanks from Charlie and his family, but she'd also received four calls from the news people about the bomb. It would take a while before things died down.<br>Now, alone in her bedroom, Ella sat at the small table that held her desktop computer and waited. She'd have to return to the police station soon, but the only way her contact, "Coyote," ever surfaced was through her Internet provider.<br>The bitterly cold January winds swept down the hillside behind her mother's home, rattling dust and sand against the window. It was said that Wind carried news, but Wind had met its equal in this age of computers.<br>Coyote's information so far had been as good as gold, though all she really knew about him was that he was probably an undercover cop--federal, most likely. His knowledge of her background in the FBI and his use of certain terms all supported that theory.<br>Hearing a soft bell tone, she glanced down at the screen and saw the instant message box. Coyote was on line. As she read the message, she reached over and hit the print command. The message would vanish from the screen the second she logged off, and there would be no record of it anywhere. It was now or never.<br>Ella thought of the many times she'd tried to track down Coyote, despite his warnings not to try. She'd been discreet, but persistent. Yet, despite all the methods available to her, she'd turned up nothing.<br>"<i>Shim�</i>, come eat," Dawn said, using the Navajo word for "mother" her grandmother Rose had taught her. When Ella didn't stand up right away, Dawn crawled up onto Ella's lap.<br>"Hi, sweetie." Ella brushed a kiss on her daughter's chubby little cheek as she typed a question for Coyote. If the past was any indication, unless she was fast, he'd log off before she even finished the sentence. "Go back to the kitchen and tell your <i>shimas�n�</i>, your grandmother, that I'll be there in one minute." Ella smiled as her daughter scampered off. Rose wouldn't allow Dawn to call her grandma. The Navajo equivalent was all she would accept.<br>Ella leaned back in her garage sale captain's chair and read Coyote's message again as she waited for his reply. His warnings were always unsettling, and this time was no exception.<br>* * *<br>The petty crimes all over the Rez are being engineered to make the cops and tribal government look bad. They want politicians voted out and new people brought in who are more in favor of tribal gaming.<br>* * *<br>Ella stared at the clear-cut message. Coyote's case was more involved than the happenings on the Navajo Nation. He was trying to find evidence against a group of Intertribal Native American activists he claimed were trying to gain control of gambling operations on tribal lands across the nation. Coyote believed the <i>Dinetah</i> was their main target now.<br>But without more evidence she couldn't do a thing. The question she'd typed was the same as always. What proof could he give her so she could act? But he hadn't answered her and, now, he was off-line.<br>Ella took the printout and placed it in an unlabeled file folder along with the rest. Sensing that someone had come into her room, Ella turned and smiled as she saw her mother standing inside the doorway.<br>"Since your daughter's father canceled his visit again, I think we should eat now. You'll have to leave for the station before long."<br>Ella nodded. Rose Destea, her mother, was in her sixties and her once raven hair was now a dozen shades of gray and white. She'd slowed down some in the past few years, but she was still a force to be reckoned with and had a stubborn streak a mile long.<br>Rose came up behind her and read the message on the computer screen. "'Coyote,' huh? That's not a Navajo writing you. Must be an Anglo trying to sound like an Indian."<br>Ella shrugged. "Maybe. I don't really know. But, Mom, this is confidential police business, so you can't tell anyone. Only Big Ed knows about Coyote, and that's because he's my boss and the chief of police."<br>"I won't say anything, daughter. But I'm still very worried. You could have been killed by that bomb yesterday."<br>"I know. The police force is doing its best, but the situation is a lot more complicated than it appears at first glance."<br>"Yes, I know. I read enough of that message to know that there's more to what's happening than has been made public," Rose answered.<br>"The bottom line is that we really aren't sure what we're dealing with yet."<br>"Just remember that you have to be more careful these days. You can't afford to take as many chances as you did before. You now have a daughter who needs you."<br>Ella could hear Dawn playing with Two, the family dog, out in the living room. The pair had become fast friends. "She's changed everything for me, Mom, but I'm still a cop. I have a duty to the tribe. But it's because of her that I wear a vest practically all the time, even in summer when it's sweltering."<br>"I wish you would find another line of work."<br>"Mom, we should all be grateful I have a job that's secure. A lot of our people are scrambling for work right now. If I wasn't a cop, I'd probably be out looking frantically for a job off the Rez, hoping to find something that paid me enough to be able to provide for our family."<br>Rose sat on the edge of the bed, running her weathered hand over the hand-stitched quilt absently. "Times are especially hard for the <i>Dineh</i> right now. Last year's dry winter, followed by a late frost and an even drier summer, wiped out a lot of the crops. When the weather does that to us, people and their livestock go hungry. And, now, when money's tightest and the tribe is least able to handle it, we get hit by another bad winter, the coldest we've had in years. Many of our people are having to choose between food and heat."<br>Silence stretched out, but Ella waited to make sure that her mother had finished speaking before she said anything. Navajos seldom had rapid, overlapping conversations like some other cultures did. Here, it was a sign of poor manners to speak before another was finished, and long, thoughtful pauses were not unusual.<br>"It's been miserably cold," Ella said at last, "but we still haven't got much snow to show for it except for a little in the mountains. If we don't get some moisture soon, we'll have another dry growing season ahead."<br>"I have a feeling it's going to go from bad to worse before it's over," Rose said, shaking her head. "Many of the businesses on the <i>Dinetah</i>, the tribal land, have already had to close their doors, and more will soon follow. There's not much money for people to buy things these days. Did I tell you that I saw Dezbah Nez the other day? Her son and his family have gone to Phoenix looking for jobs. They heard that some of our people are finding work there in the fast-food places or cleaning offices at night. It's all minimum-wage jobs, but it'll help them stay afloat with everyone working. It's the ones who can't or won't leave the Rez that worry me the most. The only thing that's abundant here now is hunger and cold. The tribal government has to wake up and try to do more to help our people."<br>"How? There isn't much money in the tribal accounts either. The tribe applied for federal help, but things like that take forever. State and national politicians are slow to get involved since we don't have enough votes to change any election results, or money to support their candidates."<br>"We have to do <i>something</i>. Many of the older ones in the outlying areas won't make it to spring without help. Did you hear that Jim Joe is sick again? Their old wood-stove has got a crack in the firebox, and he couldn't fix it. It can't be welded, either. With the temperature the way it has been..." She shook her head again. "And like many traditionalists, he won't go to the hospital, even though he's running a fever. He said that people die there and their <i>chindi</i> stay, ready to get anyone who's still alive."<br>Ella sighed. The fear that the <i>chindi</i>, the evil in a man that remained earthbound after death, would contaminate and harm the living kept many of the old ones away from the hospitals. It was a decision that cost lives every year.<br>"His son should have taken him anyway," Ella said flatly.<br>"And end up frightening his father to death?" Rose shook her head. "You forget how things are here."<br>"No, Mom. I didn't forget. I'm '<i>aln�</i>." The word meant a person who walked the line between two cultures--a person who was constantly split in half.<br>"You are what you've chosen to be," Rose said, then stood, smoothing out the quilt. "Come on, daughter. Let's have dinner before you go back to work. I've fixed your favorite, mutton stew and fry bread."<br>"I thought that was what I smelled coming from the kitchen. Stew will really hit the spot tonight. I need something warm besides coffee inside me before I go out on patrol."<br>The simple, traditional meal was especially tasty, or Ella was particularly hungry tonight. She really wasn't sure which it was. As Ella hurried through dinner, her mother fed Dawn as she always did on the days Ella had to go back to work.<br>Ella looked at Dawn and sighed. These days her cute, black-haired daughter with those big, sparkling eyes that could melt butter wore as much food as she actually ate. At the moment, her little hands-were submerged in the bowl even as Rose fed her bite-sized pieces of stew.<br>"Don't play with your food," Ella told Dawn.<br>Rose glowered at her. She didn't like Ella to correct Dawn while she was eating.<br>"Mom, she's making a mess," Ella said, answering the unspoken criticism.<br>"You were worse at her age."<br>It was her mother's standard answer.<br>"<i>Shizh�'�</i> come?" Dawn looked up, her chin dripping with broth.<br>"Not today. Your father was busy," Ella said. "But he told me he'd come by as soon as he can."<br>Rose shot Ella a look that spoke volumes.<br>Ella shook her head, and glanced away. She didn't want Rose to ever say anything disparaging about Kevin in front of her daughter. Kevin was, after all, Dawn's father.<br>Ella finished her meal while Dawn chattered away, ignoring the rest of her stew.<br>"I want to play, <i>Shimas�n�</i>," Dawn said, sliding off her grandmother's lap and standing impatiently as Rose wiped her face and hands with a napkin.<br>"Then go. You've eaten enough."<br>Ella shook her head as Dawn scampered into the living room. "Mom, you really shouldn't excuse her until we're all finished."<br>"Those <i>bilag�ana</i> rules will still be around when she's older. Right now with all her energy, she's doing well just to sit and eat as long as she does."<br>Knowing the futility of an argument, Ella stood, placed her dirty dishes in the sink, then washed and dried her hands. "My daughter's father said he might come by later. If he does, try to be nice to him," she said, avoiding mentioning Kevin by name out of respect for Rose's beliefs. Her mother was a traditionalist who believed names were endowed with power a person could draw upon in times of danger. But using them often weakened that power and depleted their owner. In this house, only the names of their enemies were used freely.<br>"He won't come. There will just be another excuse. It makes him nervous to be around her, you know. He doesn't understand her when she speaks, and has no idea what to say or do with a child."<br>"I'm sure he understands her, Mom. She speaks clearly enough," Ella said. "And two languages. What more can you ask of a two-year-old?"<br>"I think he wants her to discuss law and tribal politics."<br>Ella laughed. "Mom, you really shouldn't be so hard on him. He <i>does</i> try." Ella knew she wasn't going to change her mother's mind about this or anything else, but she had to say something. "Remember not to discuss Coyote or anything else you saw on that computer screen with anyone."<br>"I <i>never</i> discuss your work, daughter. It's about the only thing I can do to protect you these days."<br>Ella gave her mother a light kiss on the cheek. "I'll see you later, then. Don't bother waiting up for me." She took her pistol and holster from the top shelf in the kitchen and clipped them onto her wide leather belt. After a quick good-bye to her daughter, she put on her heavy jacket and walked out to her vehicle across the hard, frozen ground.<br>Big Ed Atcitty would be around the station for another hour or so, which was good because she needed to talk to him.<br>Fifteen minutes later she walked through the side doors of the Shiprock station. Before she'd gotten more than a few feet down the hall, Sergeant Joseph Neskahi stepped out of the squad room and intercepted her.<br>"The chief wants to see you before you and Justine go out tonight." The young-looking, barrel-chested officer still wore his hair in a buzz cut despite the winter, weather.<br>"Okay, thanks," Ella answered. Neskahi was a fine officer, and they'd worked well together, sometimes in the most dangerous circumstances imaginable.<br>As she turned the corner and headed down the hall, she spotted Big Ed Atcitty standing in the doorway to his office. "I thought I heard you out here, Shorty." He'd given her the nickname as a joke since Ella was a full head taller than he was. "Come in. We need to talk."<br>Ella followed her boss into his office, then sat down as he waved in the direction of a chair. If Neskahi was barrel-chested, then Big Ed Atcitty was a redwood stump, impervious to age and impossible to knock over.<br>Seeing him close the door behind them signaled to Ella that the discussion was going to be more than just a quick briefing on operations.<br>Big Ed's expression was somber. "I'm very concerned over what happened yesterday with that bomb. That's not just another prank, it represents a real escalation in the vandalism we've been fighting. Just a few seconds one way or the other, and neither you or Charlie would have been around to tell the story. I want you to track down the explosives and nail whoever was behind this. Taking a baseball bat to a mailbox is one thing, but setting off explosives is a big step up."<br>Big Ed leaned back in his chair, rocking gently for a moment. "We need to send out a message to the community that we don't take an incident like this lightly. I just wish we had a clue who's behind it, and why. The whole thing is frustrating, trying to watch thousands of square miles with a handful of officers while carrying out our normal patrols and investigations."<br>"We're in a bind, that's for sure. I'll put the SI team on it," Ella said. "Is there anything else you wanted to talk to me about?"<br>He exhaled softly, and nodded. "Let me cut to the chase. I've heard that Officer Goodluck is having a problem qualifying with her weapon." He leaned forward, opening a folder on his desk and looking through the papers briefly. "She barely made it, as a matter of fact."<br>"Chief, those lowlifes cut off half of Justin...</p><h2>The Elagin Affair: And Other Stories</h2><p>Graham Hettlinger's brilliant translations of Bunin's stories in <i>Sunstroke</i> (2002) were widely acclaimed. In <i>The Elagin Affair</i>, Mr. Hettlinger continues to acquaint English-language readers with a Bunin they may not have appreciated. Bunin's sensual, elaborate, and highly rhythmic prose has proven deeply resistant to earlier translations. In these new stories, Mr. Hettlinger captures both the music and the grace, as well as the literal meaning, of Bunin's renowned prose. <i>The Elagin Affair</i> contains three of the author's greatest novellas, the title piece, "Mitya's Love," and "Sukhodol" as well as a broad range of stories written between 1900 and 1940 and centered on themes of love, loss, and the Russian landscape, including several of Bunin's most haunting stories from his final collection, <i>Dark Avenues</i>.<br><br>Praise for <i>Sunstroke</i>, Graham Hettlinger's first translations of Ivan Bunin:<br><br>"Bunin is, unaccountably, the least translated of the great Russian writers (and his best work ranks with that of Turgenev and Chekhov).

How could she convince him he was wrong?</p><p></p><h2>Lucky Hans and Other Merz Fairy Tales (Oddly Modern Fairy Tales, 2)</h2><p><p>Kurt Schwitters revolutionized the art world in the 1920s with his Dadaist Merz collages, theater performances, and poetry. But at the same time he was also writing extraordinary fairy tales that were turning the genre upside down and inside out. <i>Lucky Hans and Other Merz Fairy Tales</i> is the first collection of these subversive, little-known stories in any language and the first time all but a few of them have appeared in English. Translated and introduced by Jack Zipes, one of the world's leading authorities on fairy tales, this book gathers thirty-two stories written between 1925 and Schwitters's death in 1948--including a complete English-language recreation of <i>The Scarecrow</i>, a children's book illustrated with avant-garde typography that Schwitters created with Kate Steinitz and De Stijl founder Theo van Doesburg. <i>Lucky Hans and Other Merz Fairy Tales</i> also includes brilliant new illustrations that evoke the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s.</p><p> Schwitters wrote these darkly humorous, satirical, and surreal tales at a time when traditional German fairy tales were being co-opted by the Nazis. Filled with sharp critiques of German life during the Weimar and early Nazi eras, Schwitters's tales are rich with absurdist events and insist that not everyone--and perhaps not anyone--lives happily ever after. In "Lucky Hans," the starving protagonist tries to catch a rabbit only to have it shed its fur like a coat and run off naked into the forest. In other tales, a sarcastic gypsy stands in for a fairy godmother and an army recruit is arrested for growing to monstrous size.</p><p><i>Lucky Hans and Other Merz Fairy Tales</i> is a delightfully strange and surprising book.</p></p><p><p>"In these absurdist parables, Schwitters's savage clowning empties the fairy tale of its easy consolations. He revisits the traditions in the melancholic, mordant voice of irony and satire, and, as with other fabulists--Voltaire, Swift, Kafka, Capek--his stories still speak to us now as freshly as when they were written, and entertain us richly."--<b>Marina Warner, author of <i>Phantasmagoria</i></b></p><p>"Kurt Schwitters's fairy tales can be safely read to children, without boring the parents. While children will be delightfully dreaming themselves in wondrous worlds, the parents can contemplate existential questions and take shortcuts to understanding the absurdity of war, the vacuity of power, and the vanity of wealth. Schwitters, the most childlike Dadaist, was a fierce defender of innocence and an equally fierce critic of society. His tales are well drawn paths in a magically lit moral landscape."--<b>Andrei Codrescu, author of <i>The Posthuman Dada Guide</i></b></p><p>"This collection of Kurt Schwitters's little-known fairy tales reveals that he was a master of literary satire in addition to being one of Weimar Germany's most prominent artists. With its elegant translations, charmingly impudent illustrations, and lively introduction, this book will earn a steady readership."--<b>Maria Tatar, editor of <i>The Classic Fairy Tales</i></b></p><p>"This is a very enjoyable collection of subversively humorous stories, and I found myself laughing out loud while reading them. The fairy tale served as apt material for Kurt Schwitters to play with conventions, produce nonsense within well-known plots, or wreak havoc in everyday routines, all in order to critique bourgeois values, religion, nationalism, and Nazism, and to open up the imaginations of children and adults to his artistic worldview."--<b>Cristina Bacchilega, author of <i>Postmodern Fairy Tales</i></b></p><p>"Schwitters's fairy tales are especially interesting because they document the vitality of experimentation in the genre that occurred in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century. While Grimms' tales were increasingly co-opted by nationalists and fascists, writers such as Schwitters sought to rewrite the genre as a form of sociopolitical resistance and cultural reformation. Translated, edited, and introduced by Jack Zipes, the world's leading expert on the fairy tale, this volume has a special value."--<b>Donald Haase, editor of <i>Marvels and Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies</i></b></p><b>Jack Zipes</b> is a leading authority on fairy tales.

G. Ballard was born in 1930 in Shanghai. After internment in a civilian prison camp, his family returned to England in 1946. His 1984 bestseller `Empire of the Sun&#39; won the Guardian Fiction Prize and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. His controversial novel `Crash&#39; was made into a film by David Cronenberg. His autobiography `Miracles of Life&#39; was published in 2008, and a collection of interviews with the author, `Extreme Metaphors&#39;, was published in 2012. J. G. Ballard passed away in 2009.Ballard is a brilliant writer whose Empire of the Sun has been his only major commercial success to date in this country. That mesmerizing novel, based on his childhood in 1930s Shanghai and internment by the Japanese, finds a sequel here. It takes the (lightly fictionalized) events of the author's life through three turbulent decades to end, ironically, with the making of the movie, with the narrator as a bemused extra, and his lifelong obsessions--with America, with planes, car crashes and the fantasies of technology--apparently exorcised. Women is a poignantly vivid account of Ballard's radically dislocated life in which the only constants have been an abiding love for his children and the variety of emotional and erotic consolations provided by a number of different, beautifully drawn women. Beginning with young Jamie back in embattled Shanghai, the novel follows him through return to England, an abortive fling at medical school and a try at flying for the R.A.F. before he settles into an idyllic marriage and the birth of his children--symbolically, in a Thames-side community next door to the great film studios where Empire would one day be recreated. The accidental death of his wife, hitting him, and the reader, with horrifying suddenness, is followed by years of bleakness, including drug experiments in the dizzy '60s, and a gradual return to calm resignation as some of his old friends die off around him. The story's outline may sound banal, but Ballard writing at the top of his powers offers an immediacy that is often visceral. His eye has never been more cinematic, and his love scenes, sexually explicit and often of older people no longer in their physical prime, are touchingly human and moving. But much is moving here: the way Ballard and the children cope with Miriam's death, the changes in a wild bohemian girl as she ages, the cancer death of a friend, the saving of a small girl from drowning. The Kindness of Women is full of scenes and moments that linger hauntingly in the mind, a piercingly honest, vibrant record of a very contemporary life. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Old Spanish Trail: From Santa Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles, California (Famous American Trails Series)</h2><p>Describes the Old Spanish Trail and the pioneers who settled in California.</p><p>Arlan Dean lives in New York, NY.</p><h2>The Parable Book</h2><p><p>"The love that dare not speak its name . . ." </p><p>Sweden, 1949.

Suarez was so successful in writing a systematic presentation of metaphysics - that was not a commentary on Aristotle - that his work was used as a university textbook and as a model for aspiring metaphysicians for over a hundred years, not only by his fellow Jesuits, but also, perhaps to an even greater extent, by Protestant scholastic philosophers and theologians. Suarez&#39;s influence was not restricted to the scholastic tradition; rather, it extended, both through that tradition and independently of it, into the main currents of modern thought. It can be detected in Descartes, Leibniz, Wolf and, ultimately, in Kant himself. So pervasive was Suarez&#39;s influence on modern thought, that Alasdair Maclntyre has called Suarez the first truly modern philosopher. Even apart from its historical influence, Suarez&#39;s work remains important for its intrinsic merit. It could be very reasonably argued that Suarez produced the most perfect incarnation of the type of realistic metaphysics initiated by Aristotle. As long, therefore, as Aristotelianism remains a live option for philosophers, Suarez&#39;s work will remain valuable to those engaged in the philosophical enterprise. Disputation XV, which deals with the formal principle of the nature of material substances, that is, their substantial form, is central to Suarez&#39;s presentation of Aristotelian realism. In the Disputation Suarez defended the view, contrary to both dualism and materialism, that material objects are constituted by two co-principles, primary matter and substantial form. The two translators, Jeremiah Reedy and John Kronen, have produced a clear and readable translation of this Disputation central to Suarezian metaphysics. In his introduction and notes to the translation Kronen clearly explains the metaphysics of substantial form and clarifies many of the problems which Suarez discusses.</p><p></p><h2>My Name Used to Be Muhammad: The True Story of a Muslim Who Became a Christian</h2><p>Tito Momen was raised Muhammad Momen. He was born in Nigeria and taught to observe the strict teachings of Islam. Beginning at age five he woke at 4:45 every morning to attend the mosque and perform dawn prayer with the other men in his village. He began training to memorize the Qur an at age six by copying the entire Qur an word for word. He was being raised to become a leader among clerics, capable of leading a jihad, or holy struggle, to convert nonbelievers to Islam. But Tito s path took an unexpected turn when he was introduced to Christianity. His decision to believe in Jesus Christ cost him his family and his freedom. Tito thought he would spend his remaining days enduring a life sentence in an uncivilized Egyptian prison. For fifteen years he suffered and waited and prayed. Tito says, I never gave up hope. I never stopped believing. Although he was falsely imprisoned, beaten, and ridiculed, Tito s remarkable true story is one of faith, forgiveness, and testimony that God does hear and answer prayers.</p><p>Tito Momen was raised Muhammad Momen.

In <i>Sonnet's Shakespeare</i>, Sonnet L'Abb� decides to explore her own colonizing impulses, turning them on the Bard, intent on "taking his place" in the poetic canon.<br>In a defiant act of literary patricide and a feat of painstaking poetic labour, the poet works with the pages of Shakespeare's sonnets as territory she will inhabit. Letter by letter, she settles her own language into the white spaces of Shakespeare's poems, until she overwhelms the original text and effectively erases Shakespeare's voice by assimilating his words into hers. In each of the 154 dense new poems of <i>Sonnet's Shakespeare</i> sits one "colonized" Shakespearean sonnet--displaced, spoken over, but never entirely silenced. L'Abb� invented the process to find a way to sing from a body that knows both oppression and privilege. Think Christian B�k's <i>Eunoia</i> meets Claudia Rankine's <i>Citizen</i>--L'Abb� has used the procedural techniques of Oulipian constraint and erasure poetries to harness the raw energies of her hyperconfessional, trauma-forged lyric voice.<br>This is a writer's magnum opus and mixed-race girl's diary; the voice of a settler on aboriginal territory and a sexual assault survivor, the mash-up stylings of a Sylvia Plath and Public Enemy fan. Touching on such themes as gender trouble and video games, Indigenous resurgence, the role of poetry, and the search for interracial love, this book is one that "Shakespeare will forever sub-utter," a poetic achievement of massive scope and historical significance.</p><p>SONNET L'ABBE is the author of two previous collections of poetry,<i> A Strange Relief </i>and <i>Killarnoe</i>, and, most recently, the chapbook <i>Anima Canadensis</i>. In 2000, she won the Bronwen Wallace Memorial Award for most promising writer under 35. In 2014, she was the guest editor of<i> Best Canadian Poetry in English</i>. Her work has been internationally published and anthologized. L'Abb� lives on Vancouver Island and is a professor of creative writing at Vancouver Island University."To embody an experience, to retell histories, to open doors and windows--Sonnet L'Abb�'s <i>Sonnet's Shakespeare </i>is the key. Whether you are versed in Shakespeare or not, you will be mesmerized by L'Abb�'s beautifully choreographed dance through a city's secrets. She offers movements we've not seen before. I want to thank L'Abb� for allowing readers to reside in the space where erasure meets found poem. L'Abb� is a form-bending master." --<b>Chelene Knight, author of <i>Dear Current Occupant</i></b> <p></p>"Sonnet L'Abb�'s writing in <i>Sonnet's Shakespeare </i>is simply stunning. L'Abb�'s conceptual engagement with colonial history urges us to consider how deeply internalized and invisible colonial structures can be while also being both an incredibly funny and dazzlingly inventive book. This is brilliant work!" <b>--Jordan Abel, author of </b><i><b>Injun</b> <p></p></i>"Sonnet homers Shakespeare! Dense-lush-arcane-jubilant in their brute-belle word swagger, these prose poems take up Shakespeare's wit-layered language and expand its cardiac capacity. The result is a personal poetix odyssey that confronts and condenses our aching moment in Canadian consumer colonial time. Mouthing Will's sweet words and tough-smart longings, gunning his impolitic politics and trafficking new gender sweat and sway, loving friends and calling out the frenemies, this fearless brown-girl sonnetteer straps on and refashions poetic speech. Hers is a tale that tells off idiots, signifies everything, and is rooted--as are Shakespeare's sonnets--in the power of wordly love." <b>--Er�n Moure, author of<i><i> The Elements</i><br></i></b></p><h2>The Seven Heroes and Five Gallants (Panda Series)</h2><p>Late in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) a large number of novels about chivalrous heros and complicated legal cases appeared in Chinese literature. One of the most enduring and popular folk legends of China has been the story of Lord Bao and his seven heroes and five gallants, whose exploits were sung of in ballads, operas and songs for over a thousand years. <p>The central hero is Lord Bao, who rises from humble beginnings to high office at the imperial court, gathering around him a group of Robin Hood-type men to fight crime and corruption. The seven heroes of the imperial court form a musketeer-like relationship with the five gallants, and roam around rescuing maidens in distress, succouring the old and weak, using their exceptional fighting talents to kill evildoers. </p><p>The adventures of the seven heroes and five gallants provide much insight into traditions that have formed the Chinese character through the ages.</p></p><p></p><h2>Steps</h2><p>A portrayal of men and women both aroused and desensitized by an environment that disdains the individual and seeks control over the imagination.</p><p></p><h2>The Vegetarian Shabbat Cookbook</h2><p>This cookbook combines the great tradition of the Sabbath with vegan cooking.

This happened in Los Angeles, on the TV show <i>Politically Incorrect</i>. People yell a lot on that show. One time I was on there with Micky Dolenz; he yelled at me, too. Back when I used to watch The Monkees on TV, I never dreamed that one day, one of them would be yelling at me personally regarding current events. This is a great nation. <br>Guests are encouraged to express strong views on <i>Politically Incorrect,</i> because it makes for better entertainment. The host, Bill Maher, could name any topic at all -- say, monetary reform in the 17th-century Netherlands -- and we guests would immediately be at each other's throats over it, even if we were not totally certain what "Netherlands" are. <br>I was on <i>Politically Incorrect</i> because I was on a book tour. You go on whatever show they tell you to go on, in hopes that the host will at some point hold your book up to the camera, causing consumers all over America to rush to bookstores to purchase it. You will basically do anything to get your book on TV. For example, a few days earlier, I let a total stranger commit a major act of gel on my hair. This was on <i>The Today Show,</i> in New York. I was sitting in the makeup room, drinking coffee, trying to wake up, and the makeup person, after studying my head, called the hair person over, pointed at my hair, and said: "See? This is exactly what I was talking about." <br>Then they both laughed, and the hair person, before I knew what was happening, applied 37 pounds of Industrial Concrete Strength gel in my hair, and thus I appeared on national television looking like Eddie Munster. This would have been fine if the reaction of the world at large had been to rush out and purchase my book, but the actual reaction, to judge from the people I know who saw the show, was to ask: "What happened to your hair?" <br>But getting back to Vicki Lawrence: She was yelling at me about the death penalty, and I was yelling back at her, while simultaneously -- and I am NOT proud of this -- holding my hand over the mouth of another guest, Sol Wachtler, a former chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals who got into trouble over a woman and went to jail and, needless to say, wrote a book. I was silencing him so that I could better express my very strongly held views on the death penalty, although now I honestly cannot remember what those specific views were. <br>I do remember that before the show, when I was in the waiting room with Vicki Lawrence, somebody brought up her hit song, "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia," which has an extremely complicated plot. I have never met anybody who understood what that song is about, so I figured this was my big chance to find out. <br>"What is that song about?" I asked Vicki Lawrence. <br>"I have absolutely no idea," she said. <br>Here's a coincidence: Vicki Lawrence was once a regular on <i>The Carol Burnett Show,</i> and earlier that same day, I met: Carol Burnett! Yes! A comedy goddess! A star who, in my mind, is bigger than all the ex-Monkees <i>combined</i>. She and I were waiting to appear on the early-morning news show on Los Angeles TV station KTLA. I still don't know why Carol Burnett was there; I don't think she has a book out. I do know that we were both preceded on the show by a lengthy live news report in which the reporter wound up stripping down to her bathing suit and -- I am not making this up -- taking a shower with a live iguana. I don't know whether the iguana has a book out, but I would not bet against it. <br>The next day I was on a show called <i>Home &amp; Family,</i> which is broadcast from a house on the Universal Studios lot, just a short distance from the house where Tony Perkins stabbed Janet Leigh to death in <i>Psycho</i>. I found myself sitting on a long sofa with -- these are just <i>some</i> of the people who were on that sofa -- two co-hosts; Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner; an Italian cookbook author; two large spherical home-improvement contractors wearing matching bright-yellow overalls that would be visible from Mars; two women who wrote a book about something like how to feed a family of 117 people for 23 cents a day; and a complete set of quintuplets. <br>We did not, to my recollection, discuss the death penalty, but we did change locations a lot; every now and then, for no apparent reason, we'd all jump up and move, herd-like, into another room, where we'd watch somebody show us how to do some Home and Family thing such as baste a turkey. For all I know, that show is still going on. After a while, without being formally excused, I just sort of drifted outside and left, moving briskly past the <i>Psycho</i> house. <br>Yes, the book tour was a lot of effort, but it definitely increased the overall public awareness of my name. I know this because my last appearance was on <i>The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder,</i> and at one point, when we came back from a commercial, Tom Snyder, who was not joking, introduced me to the audience as "Chuck Berry." I was not offended; I'm a big fan of Chuck. But if he has a book out, I want a piece of the royalties.</p><h2>Modern Classics Brideshead Revisited Centennial Edition</h2><p>This is the most nostalgic and reflective of Evelyn Waugh&#39;s novels, &#34;Brideshead Revisited&#34; looks back to the golden age before the Second World War. It tells the story of Charles Ryder&#39;s infatuation with the Marchmain family and the rapidly disappearing world of privilege they inhabit. Enchanted first by Sebastian at Oxford then by his doomed Catholic family, in particular his remote sister, Julia, Charles comes finally to recognize his spiritual and social distance from them.</p><p>A departure from Evelyn Waugh's normally comic theater, <b>Brideshead Revisited</b> concerns the tale of Charles Ryder, a captain in the British Army in post-World War I England. Unlike Waugh's previous narrators, Ryder is an intelligent man, looking back on much of his life from his current post in Oxford. He strikes a special friendship with Lord Sebastian Flyte as the setting moves to the Brideshead estate and a baroque castle that recalls England's prior standing in the world. Ryder falls for Flyte's sister while families, politics and religions collide. What makes the book extraordinary is Waugh's sharp, vivid style and his use of dialect and minor characters. This is one of Waugh's finest accomplishments and a superb book.8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Christian Moral Principles: Way of the Lord Jesus: 1</h2><p>The User&#39;s Guide and Preface includes a key to the references within the text and in the footnotes along with other information likely to be helpful to serious readers.

Here, Ely looks closely at the changing responses of both blacks and whites to Amos 'n' Andy and examines what they reveal about the evolution of racial attitudes during the decades from the 1920's, when the series first aired, to the 50's, when it was transplanted to network TV. Born too late to experience the phenomenon except through TV reruns in the 1950's and 60's, Ely nevertheless writes knowingly of Amos 'n' Andy, having pored over hundreds of old scripts, newspaper clippings and fan letters. He looks at its roots in the minstrel shows in which its white writers (and radio performers) Charles Correll and Freeman Gosden learned their trade, and he examines how it won the hearts of millions and created dismay and antagonism in the minds of many. Although it had a huge following among both blacks and whites, thoughtful blacks were always divided in their appraisal--some seeing it as harmful to black self-respect and poisonous to whites' perceptions of blacks, and others finding no racism in its humor. Nor were its critics consistent--some who had praised it in the 30's damned it in the 50's, and vice versa. Ely traces the history of the show and its impact on a changing society with diligence, providing an extensive paper trail for future researchers in American social history. An earnest and thoughtful contribution to the growing literature documenting the development of black consciousness in American society. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Newton, an extraterrestrial on a mission to save his home planet, crash lands on earth, where he is condemned to a life of loneliness as he tries to build another spaceship</p><p>T.J. Newton is an extraterrestrial who goes to Earth on a desperate mission of mercy. But instead of aid, Newton discovers loneliness and despair that ultimately ends in tragedy.Walter Tevis (1928-1984) was an American novelist and short-story writer. He is best known for his novels The Hustler and The Man Who Fell to Earth which were adapted for film. He wrote three more novels -- Mockingbird, The Steps of the Sun and The Queen&#39;s Gambit - and a collection of short stories, Far From Home. He died in 1984.</p><h2>Revivalism, Social Conscience, and Community in the Burned-Over District: The Trial of Rhoda Bement</h2><p><p>In 1843 in Seneca Falls, New York, Rhonda Bement was brought before a disciplinary trial at her church, the First Presbyterian Church, charged with "unchristian and unladylike" behavior. Her transgression was to challenge the authority and integrity of her minister because he had refused to read to the congregation her announcement about abolitionist lectures taking place in the village, and she was eventually excommunicated. The transcript of her trial is the centerpiece of <i>Revivalism, Social Conscience, and Community in the Burned-Over District</i>, which presents through the testimonies of the witnesses the tensions between organized religion and the reform movements of abolitionism, temperance, and women's rights that were sweeping the country in this period.</p><p>The book is divided into three parts. Jan M. Saltzgaber sets the stage in an introductory essay that examines the religious and social ramifications of the Second Great Awakening in the "burned-over" region of New York, analyzing in detail the changing social and economic environment of Seneca Falls and delineating connections between these changes and the currents of revival and reform in the 1830s and 1840s. The fully-annotated text of the trial is then presented in its entirety. In the epilogue, Glenn C. Altschuler uses the trial and evidence from other local churches to reassess the divisive effects of revivalism, stressing local conditions and church practices that acted as centripetal forces that impressed conservatives, moderates, and even "ultraists" with the importance of church unity.</p></p><p><p>Glenn C.

Featuring both well-known documents and material printed or collected here for the first time, this book offers a broad range of writings that convey impressions of Dickinson in her own time and for the first decades following the publication of her poems. It all begins with her school days and continues to the centennial of her birth in 1930.<br> <br> In addition, promotional items, reviews, and correspondence relating to early publications are included, as well as some later documents that reveal the changing assessments of Dickinson&#x2019;s poetry in response to evolving critical standards. These documents provide evidence that counters many popular conceptions of her life and reception, such as the belief that the writer best known for poems focused on loss, death, and immortality was herself a morose soul. In fact, those who knew her found her humorous, playful, and interested in other people.<br> <br> Dickinson maintained literary and personal correspondence with major representatives of the national literary scene, developing a reputation as a remarkable writer even as she maintained extreme levels of privacy. Evidence compiled here also demonstrates that she herself made considerable provision for the survival of her poems and laid the groundwork for their eventual publication. <i>Dickinson in Her Own Time</i> reveals the poet as her contemporaries knew her, before her legend took hold.<br></p></p><p><b>Jane Donahue Eberwein </b>of Birmingham, Michigan, is distinguished professor of English, <i>emerita</i>, at Oakland University.

Viv narrowed her hooded eyes and inhaled through dilated nostrils.</p><p>"Anyone would think you were jealous," Fitz commented, grimacing as he took a sip of cheap French wine.

She's a very selfish creature, but one can't help being drawn to her. The ubiquitous moth to the flame. Though, in my case, not a moth at all but a rather beautifully dressed butterfly." She wandered across the deck and draped herself over a chair, spreading her blue and pink caftan about her like silken wings. "Still, I enjoy her life. It'll do for a book one day, when we're no longer friends. I think Alba's like that. She enjoys people, then moves on. In our case, it shall be I who moves on. By then, the dramas of her life will no longer entertain me and, besides, I'll have grown bored of the Thames too. My old bones will ache from the damp, and the creaking and bumping will keep me up at night. Then I shall buy a small ch�teau in France and retire to obscurity, fame having become a bore too."

But Fitz was no longer listening, although it was his job to.</p><p>"Do you think they pay for it?" he said, putting his hands on the railing and looking down into the muddy water of the Thames. Beside him, Sprout, his old springer spaniel, lay sleeping on a blanket.</p><p>"Certainly not!" she retorted. "Her father owns the boat. She's not having to fork out twelve pounds a week in rent, I assure you."</p><p>"Then she's simply liberated."</p><p>"Just like everyone else of her generation. Following the herd. It bores me. I was before my time, Fitzroy. I took lovers and smoked cannabis long before the Albas of this world knew of the existence of either. Now I prefer bog standard Silva Thins and celibacy. I'm fifty, too old to be a slave to fashion. It's all so frivolous and childish. Better to set my mind on higher things. You may be a good ten years younger than me, Fitzroy, but I can tell the world of fashion bores you too."</p><p>"I don't think Alba would bore me."</p><p>"But you, my dear, would bore her, eventually. You might think you're a swaggering Lothario, Fitzroy, but you'd meet your match in Alba. She isn't like other girls. I'm not saying you'd have trouble bedding her, but keeping her, now that's a very different story. She likes variety. Her lovers don't last long. I've seen them come and go. It's always the same, they skip up the gangplank; then, when it's all over, they plod off like ill-treated mongrels. She'd have you for dinner then spit you out like a chicken bone, and that would be a shock, wouldn't it, darling? I bet no one's ever done that to you before. It's called karma. What goes around, comes around. Pay you back for breaking so many hearts. Anyway, at your age, you should be looking for your third wife, not a transitory thrill. You should be settling down. Set your heart on one woman and keep it there. She's fiery because she's half Italian."</p><p>"Ah, that explains the dark hair and honey skin."</p><p>Viv looked at him askance and her thin lips extended into an even thinner smile.</p><p>"But those very pale eyes, strange..." He sighed, no longer noticing the taste of cheap wine.</p><p>"Her mother was Italian. She died when Alba was born. In a car crash, I think. Has a horrid stepmother and a bore for a father. Navy, you know. Still there, the old fossil. Has had the same desk job since the war, I suspect. Commutes every day, very dreary. Captain Thomas Arbuckle, and he's definitely a Thomas and not a Tommy. Not like you, who are more of a Fitz than a Fitzroy, though I do love the name Fitzroy and shall continue to use it regardless. No wonder Alba rebelled."</p><p>"Her father might be a bore, but he's a rich bore." Fitz ran his eyes over the shiny wooden houseboat that gently rocked from the motion of the tide. Or from Alba's lovemaking. The thought made his stomach cramp competitively.</p><p>"Money doesn't bring happiness. You should know that, Fitzroy."</p><p>Fitz stared into his glass a moment, reflecting on his own fortune that had brought him only avaricious wives and expensive divorces.</p><p>"Does she live alone?"</p><p>"She used to live with one of her half sisters, but it didn't work out. I can't imagine the girl's easy to live with, God bless her. The trouble with you, Fitzroy, is that you fall in love much too easily. If you could keep control of your heart, life would be a lot simpler for you. You could just bed her and get her out of your system. Ah, about time too! You're late!" she exclaimed as her nephew Wilfrid hurried down the pontoon with his girlfriend Georgia in tow, full of apologies. Viv could be quite fearsome when they showed up late for bridge.</p><p></p><p>The <i>Valentina</i> was a houseboat unlike any other on Cheyne Walk. The curve of the prow was pretty, upturned, coy as if she were trying to contain a knowing smile. The house itself was painted blue and white with round windows and a balcony where pots spilled over with flowers in springtime and leaks let in the rain during the winter months. Like a face that betrays the life it has lived, so the eccentric dip in the line of the roof and the charming slope of the bow, like a rather imperious nose, revealed that perhaps she had lived many lives. The overriding characteristic of the Valentina, therefore, was her mystery. Like a grande dame who would never be seen without her makeup, the Valentina would not reveal what lay beneath her paint. Her mistress, however, loved her not for her unusual features, or her charm or indeed her uniqueness. Alba Arbuckle loved her boat for a very different reason.</p><p></p><p>"God, Alba, you're beautiful!" Rupert sighed, burying his face in her softly perfumed neck. "You taste of sugared almonds." Alba giggled, thinking him absurd, but unable to resist the sensation of his bristles that scratched and tickled and his hand that had already found its way past her blue suede clog boots and up her Mary Quant skirt. She wriggled with pleasure and lifted her chin.</p><p>"Don't talk, you fool. Kiss me."</p><p>This he did, determined to please her. He was heartened that she had suddenly come alive in his arms after a sulky supper in Chelsea. He pressed his lips to hers, relieved that as long as he entertained her tongue she couldn't use it to abuse him. Alba had a way of saying the most hurtful things through the sweetest, most beguiling, smile. And yet, those pale gray eyes of hers, like a moor on a misty winter morning, aroused a strange kind of pity that was disarming. Drew a man in. Made him yearn to protect her. To love her was easy, to keep her unlikely. But along with the other hopefuls who walked the well-trodden deck of the Valentina, he couldn't help but try.</p><p>Alba opened her eyes as he unbuttoned her blouse and took a nipple in his mouth. She looked up through the skylight to wispy pink clouds and the first twinkle of a star. Overwhelmed by the unexpected beauty of the dying day she momentarily let down her guard and her spirit was at once filled with sadness. It flooded her being and brought tears to those pale gray eyes, tears that stung. Her loneliness gnawed and ached, and nothing seemed to cure it. Appalled by the ill timing of such weakness she wound her legs around her lover and rolled over so that she sat on top, kissing and biting and clawing him like a wild cat. Rupert was stunned but more excited than ever. He eagerly ran his hands up her naked thighs to discover she wore no pants. Her buttocks lay smooth and exposed for him to caress with impatient fingers. Then he was inside her and she was riding him vigorously, as if aware only of the pleasure and not of the man who was providing it. Rupert gazed upon her in awe, longing to put his mouth to her lips that were slightly parted and bruised. She looked wanton and yet, in spite of her lack of inhibition, she possessed a vulnerability that made him yearn to hold her close.</p><p>Soon Rupert's thoughts were lost in the excitement of their lovemaking. He closed his eyes and surrendered to his desire, no longer lucid enough to contemplate her lovely face. They writhed and rolled over the piles of discarded clothes on the bed until they exploded onto the floor with a thud, out of breath and laughing. She looked at his surprised face with eyes that shone and said with a throaty chuckle, "What did you expect? The Virgin Mary?"</p><p>"That was wonderful. You're an angel," he sighed, kissing her forehead. She raised her eyebrows and laughed at him.</p><p>"I do think you're absurd, Rupert. God would throw me out of Heaven for misbehaving."</p><p>"Then that is not the Heaven for me."</p><p>Suddenly her attention was diverted by a brown scroll of paper that had been dislodged from between the wooden slats under the bed. She couldn't reach from where she was lying, so she pushed Rupert away and crawled around to the other side. She stretched her arm beneath the bed.</p><p>"What is it?" he asked, blinking at her through a postcoital daze.</p><p>"I don't know," she replied. As she stood up, she grabbed her cigarette packet and lighter from the bedside table and threw them at him. "Light me one, will you?" Then she sat on the edge of the bed and slowly unfurled the scroll of paper.</p><p>Rupert didn't smoke. In fact, he loathed cigarettes, but not wanting to appear gauche, he did as she asked, throwing himself onto the bed beside her and running an appreciative hand down her back. She stiffened. Without looking at him she said, "I've enjoyed you, Rupert. But now I want to be alone."</p><p>"What is it?" he asked, astounded that she could suddenly turn so cold.</p><p>"I said, I want to be alone." For a moment he was unsure how to react. No woman had ever treated...</p></p><h2>Campanus of Novara &amp; Medieval Planetary Theory: "Theorica Planetarum" (Medieval Science Series; No. 16) (English and Latin Edition)</h2><p>100% Satisfaction is Guaranteed!

Reprint.</p><p>Golden Spur Award-winner Sherman ( The Medicine Horn ) sets his sprawling rangeland epic on the mighty Baron ranch and lesser properties surrounding the West Texas town of Baronsville during Prohibition. When a group of rustlers led by Apache Jack Bone slaughter a prize bull and slit the throat of a young ranch hand in their rush to get purloined Baron cattle to their hideout in the untameable brasada , Matt Baron and his foreman Tom Casebolt ride into a storm to catch the criminals. Trouble is also brewing back in Baronsville: the son of a leading citizen robs a local payroll; the town's banker is being blackmailed by a rancher who wants to ruin her debt-ridden neighbors; bootleggers, Mexican-haters and the Ku Klux Klan threaten the ranchers' law-abiding ways. The relatively contemporary setting enlivens this traditional western, in which ambulances, police cars and radio broadcasts compete with buckboards, horses and stories 'round the campfire. Only a superabundance of characters (more than 140 spread over two generations) and a slightly disjointed plot line mar the fast-moving narrative spiced with salty dialogue; otherwise, it's a down-home Texas treat. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.The publisher says <i>Lonesome Dove</i> and <i>Giant</i>. <i>Dallas</i> and <i>Bonanza</i> are more like it. That's not all bad: this isn't timeless literature, but it's definitely entertaining in that miniseries kind of way--dozens of characters and a half dozen intertwining, melodramatic plots. Matt Baron, owner of the Baron Ranch in 1920s Texas, finds one of his hired hands, Jamey Dobbs, with his throat cut. Then one of Matt's prize stud bulls is castrated and mutilated. The incidents begin a series of events in which the Baron clan is pitted against some of its neighbors and into sometimes uneasy alliances with others. Among the other key characters are Baron's sister, Lou, who may be just a little tougher than her formidable brother; Ben Killian, who owns a rival ranch and is just as ambitious and loyal to his family as Matt and Lou are to the Barons; and, finally, Jake Bone, one of the more memorable villains in recent memory. Bone is a deadly mix of opportunist and sexual psychopath who is willing to kill and maim to achieve his goals or--even more chilling--set others at each other's throats to do his work for him. This is formulaic, middlebrow fiction, but it works. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i></p><h2>The Sacred Table: Creating a Jewish Food Ethic (Ccar Challenge and Change)</h2><p>The Sacred Table: Creating a Jewish Food Ethic serves up a rich dialogue about the intersection of Judaism and food. This anthology of essays explores the questions and challenges of navigating the personal and communal choices about eating. The historic Jewish approach to eating, traditionally termed Kashrut, is explored, broadened and, in some cases, challenged within this volume. Throughout The Sacred Table, Kashrut is viewed as a multifaceted Jewish relationship with food and its production, integrating values such as ethics, community, and spirituality into our dietary practice. The Sacred Table celebrates the ideology of educated choice. In exploring these complexities, this book includes topics such as food production, the environment,personal health, agricultural workers&#39; rights,animal rights, the spirituality of eating and fasting, gratitude, caring for the hungry, the challenges of eating together, and more. These essays and the questions they pose present a diverse range of voices, opinions, and options that highlight Jewish values and provide ideas about how to navigate these complex choices. Whether for the individual, family, or community, The Sacred Table supplies the basic how-to&#39;s of creating a meaningful Jewish food ethic and incorporating these choices into your personal and communal religious practices. Picture a beautiful buffet of choices from which you can shape your unique Jewish food ethic. Read, educate yourself, build on those practices that you already follow, and eat well</p><p></p><h2>Susan B. Anthony: A Biography</h2><p>Looks at Anthony&#39;s conventional Quaker upbringing and explains how she became involved in the women&#39;s suffrage movement</p><p><p>The author of the acclaimed biography Susan B. Anthony, KATHLEEN BARRY teaches in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at Pennsylvania State University. </p>The young women who left their farm homes to work in factories and boarded with Susan Anthony's Quaker family in Massachusetts, unwittingly set an example of women's emancipation for future feminist leaders, notes this comprehensive biography by feminist sociologist Barry, author of Female Sexual Slavery. Her political consciousness aroused early, Anthony's oratory was honed in the causes of temperance and anti-slavery, which she shared with other women's-rights champions such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucy Stone. Striving to rescue women from a state she considered marital feudalism, Anthony (1820-1906) organized conventions, petitioned and canvassed for support, ceaselessly campaigning for women's property and other legal rights, and most especially for suffrage. The author recounts the split in the feminist movement, factions that, after three decades, combined to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association of which Anthony was president from 1892-1900. A charismatic figure, loved and hated, internationally acclaimed, she was often ridiculed in the press as a "strident spinster." Although nationwide suffrage for women was not enacted until 1920, Anthony lived to see several of her ambitions for women fulfilled and her own role recognized.

The Surgeons&#x2019; Guild has commissioned a young artist named Rembrandt to paint Dr. Nicolaes Tulp as he performs a medical dissection. In the swirl of anticipation and intrigue surrounding the event, we meet an extraordinary constellation of men and women whose lives hinge, in some way, on Dr. Tulp&#x2019;s anatomy lesson. There is Aris the Kid, the condemned coat thief whose body is to be used for the dissection; Flora, his pregnant lover; Jan Fetchet, the curio dealer who acquires corpses for the doctor&#x2019;s work; the great Ren� Descartes, who will attend the dissection in his quest to understand where the human soul resides; and the Dutch master himself, who feels a shade uneasy about this assignment. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the story builds to its dramatic conclusion, circumstances conspire to produce a famous painting&#x2014;and an immortal painter.

He is shivering and sweating at the same time. Shivering because winter gnaws through his meager leather jerkin, sweating because of the nightmare out of which he&#x2019;s just awakened.<br><br>What he remembers is no more than an assemblage of symbols&#x2014;�a dog, a wall made of doors, an old woman with a pail full of sand&#x2014;�but fear is pounding through him insistently, demanding he return to sleep to see out the dream. There is the promise of solace through one of those doors, and a bed to lie on, something tells him. But his eyes will not close again. His other senses are already registering the day.<br><br>Horse&#x2019;s hooves tromp in the puddles somewhere nearby. There&#x2019;s a whinny and the sound of clacking steel on cobblestones. The street, which he can see only through the tiny window, is glistening from last night&#x2019;s downpour. The air smells of mineral soil, sweat, and piss.<br><br>He crosses himself before remembering where he is, then glances around nervously in hopes that no guards have seen this. He presses his callused palm through his coarse hair and slumps against the cold wall. There&#x2019;s only his cell mate, Joep van de Gheyn, the fishmonger killer, still asleep on the plank against his own wall. Aris wipes his sweat from his brow with his left hand, then rubs the stump over its bloody bandages, stifling the throbbing of the limb, which pulses with every heartbeat. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all right now. Easy there,&#x201d; he says, massaging the limb.<br><br>Hearing the bells ringing out the final chimes of the morning hour, he slaps himself to full wakefulness. This is his last day living. Each time the bells ring he&#x2019;s one step closer to the gallows.<br><br>#<br><br>Outside, there&#x2019;s a festive feeling in the frigid air. Damp and cold as it is, with clouds that hang so low they form a ceiling over the city&#x2019;s tile rooftops, there&#x2019;s still a raw excitement that pulses like a current through Amsterdam&#x2019;s quiet canals and byways. Some would call it bloodlust.<br><br>The streets echo with silence, hollow and expectant, like an empty tankard waiting to be filled. As dawn starts to creep across the water and the wharves from the swampy eastern marshlands, workers from the docks arrive with wood planks to build the hangman&#x2019;s scaffold. They drop the boards like pieces of a coffin on the square and the hammering begins. Nearby, vendors are setting up their stalls to sell delftware, wool mittens, or fresh-�baked bread to all who&#x2019;ll come to gawp.<br><br>Tacked to the town hall door is the justice day schedule:<br><br>� R. Pijnaker, age fifteen, will receive a birching for willfully stealing from a tavern keeper&#x2019;s till.<br><br>� Brothel madam S. Zeedijk shall be beaten upon her neck with a rolling pin for general lewdness, moral corruption, and running a house of debauchery.<br><br>� Three burglary conspirators, R. Tolbeit, A.

Arend was his father&#x2019;s nickname for him, meaning &#x201c;eagle.&#x201d; These days he goes by Aris, which means nothing. It was others who tacked on &#x201c;Kindt&#x201d; or &#x201c;The Kid&#x201d; years ago, on account of his small stature and since he was still lithe and smooth-�skinned when he committed his first crimes.<br><br>#<br><br>Aris draws his jerkin tighter, clinging to it with his one hand making a fist over his heart. His nightmare has already fragmented into shapes&#x2014;�the terrible slimness of a starving dog&#x2019;s back, a room of doors leading onto still other doors, his own hands painted gold, clutching a goose feather pillow. A goose feather pillow.<br><br>Beside him, snoring, is Joep van de Gheyn, the fishmonger killer. By profession he is a tailor&#x2014;�a fact that Aris finds secretly ironic, since he has spent much of his own adult life stealing fine coats from tailors&#x2019; shops. Still asleep like a babe in his mother&#x2019;s arms, the tailor has his hands pressed together in prayer under his pulpy jowls, his left foot kicking an invisible attacker.<br><br>Idiot, thinks Aris.<br><br>Still sitting, he extends his foot out toward his cell mate and nudges Joep in the ribs, not gently. &#x201c;Sleep when you&#x2019;re dead,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>The cell mate&#x2019;s eyes open, and without knowing that he&#x2019;s just been victim of a minor assault, he comes coughing out of sleep. His hacking continues until he sits up straight, only to emit two consecutive sneezes. He pulls a dirty rag out of his pocket and blows his nose profusely.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, then,&#x201d; he says, blinking his eyes to daylight.<br><br>The two convicts sit in their small cell, neither one fully awake. In the idle haze of this first hour of the last day of his own life, Aris thinks: A pillow? Has he ever laid his head on a goose feather pillow?<br><br>Flora, comes the answer. When she&#x2019;d mended him those months after he&#x2019;d got that beating in the tavern. Flora. There she was, her proud, sturdy shoulders, the catlike curve of her neck, that com�forting broad backside. She had cradled his bruised head and placed a pillow underneath, hadn&#x2019;t she?<br><br>Flora. Would Flora be out there?<br>THE HANDS<br><br>The tolling of the Westerkerk bell can be heard more distinctly at the stately canal-�side mansion belonging to Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, who is pacing across the checkered marble floor of his sitting room. He is preparing himself to recite the speech he intends to give tonight, his wife, Margaretha, as his test audience. She is propped up in a high-�backed wooden chair in front of him, with an enormous swath of damask silk she&#x2019;s embroidering in her lap, her hands motionless, waiting.<br><br>How lovely to have the new church so close by their home, she thinks, though she doesn&#x2019;t always love the half-hour bell. What she does love is when the organist plays something special at the hour, like her favorite, Sweelinck. She would like to go and see that carillon some afternoon soon if Nicolaes could be persuaded to join her. The churchwarden from the Westerkerk has invited them personally, because of her husband&#x2019;s position, of course, but he hasn&#x2019;t yet accepted. Of late, he has been so preoccupied with politicking that he has no time for any leisure activities. Tomorrow will be election day at last, and tonight he has the opportunity to convince the city&#x2019;s current burghermasters and aldermen that he is sufficiently learned and stoical to be elevated beyond a mere magistrate.<br><br>She hopes her husband will accept the warden&#x2019;s offer. It is a rare thing that such a grand church should be erected so close to their home, and she could use a small diversion from the household and his five children. Perhaps she will suggest the warden as a useful ally in his campaign. They might even be among the city&#x2019;s first visitors to the beautiful tower. What a view there must be from up there!<br><br>Tulp takes a ceremonial step forward. &#x201c;Most excellent and ornate men of Amsterdam: Honorable Burgomaster Bicker, Amsterdam burghers, gentlemen of the Stadtholder&#x2019;s court, magistrates, inspectors Collegii Medici, physicians, barber-�surgeons . . .&#x201d; he begins a bit shakily.<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome to the second public dissection of my term as prae�lector of the Amsterdam Surgeons&#x2019; Guild . . .&#x201d; He continues, and Margaretha follows the rhythms of his inflections and gathers the melody of his voice, working its way up and down the scale. She begins drawing her needle back and forth through the fabric, looking down on each stitch to check her progress on the tulip she is incorporating into the damask curtains of the entry hall.<br><br>She has based the design on the potted admirael over on the mantel, a recent gift to her husband from Roemer Visscher, in appreciation for treating the poet&#x2019;s gallstones. So far, she has managed to complete the white of the petals and now she is continuing with the red parts; her embroidered flower has no stem. She is considering adding a stem now, but that would involve going back upstairs to get the green floss in the basket that she&#x2019;d absentmindedly left on the landing. The green floss. If only she&#x2019;d remembered to bring down the green floss. She doesn&#x2019;t want to disrupt her husband, who&#x2019;s lost sleep for several nights already in anticipation of the important evening ahead, but if she had the green floss she could perhaps finally finish this tulip while listening.<br><br>&#x201c;At the request of the governors of our noble guild, I do humbly come before you to offer my annual lecture upon the human body and the fabric of nature . . .&#x201d;<br><br>He has commissioned this new painter at Uylenburgh&#x2019;s studio to commemorate his dissection tonight. It&#x2019;s his second year as praelector, but this follows a tradition. Each of the previous praelectors has commissioned a portrait of the guild when they&#x2019;ve taken the helm, with themselves at center stage. She hopes the artist will focus on his kind, almost innocent eyes, which were what attracted her to him and which she still finds comforting whenever she looks up from<br>her embroidery. He is a doctor of great compassion and skill, willing to rush out in the middle of the night to see any patient. He is a good man. A man of character.<br><br>The painter, she hopes, will capture his full head of dark hair and an ample beard that makes him look still so young. His eyes are just a tiny bit dreamy, though he works hard to appear stern and eagle-eyed.<br><br>Perhaps the painter will notice the deftness of his hands, which are, she has always felt, a touch feminine, with long elegant fingers that he often presses to his lips when in thought. He is no hearty man of the fields, certainly. The blue tint of his veins is visible through his pale skin; he&#x2019;s always had a kind of ethereal pallor that made her think he was closer to the angels. When he gives his lectures, he attempts to mask it with a touch of her rouge. The men he<br>seeks to impress&#x2014;like those who will assemble tonight in the Waag chamber for his annual anatomical display&#x2014;are not worthy of such self-concern.<br><br>She knows, as well as she can recognize the dull end of the needle now pressing against her thumb, that he will rise to his natural position in Amsterdam society in due time. Already he&#x2019;s chief praelector of the City of Amsterdam, Dr. Nicolaes Pieterszoon Tulp, occasionally referred to by the Latinate: Tulpius. She sees how eager he is to rush this process along. Perhaps the portrait itself is even a bit premature.<br><br>He clears his throat&#x2014;the sudden evacuation of a busy lecture hall&#x2014;and begins reading his speech again from the beginning, this time trying out a slightly lower vocal pitch, more sober and authoritative.<br><br>&#x201c;Most excellent and ornate men of Amsterdam: Honorable Burgomaster Bicker, Amsterdam burghers, gentlemen of the Stadtholder&#x2019;s court, . . .&#x201d; he says, glancing up to notice that his wife is still quite attentive, though her fingers have begun to work her floss through her embroidery. &#x201c;Before me, gentlemen, lies the body of a notorious criminal sentenced to death by the honorable magistrates of Amsterdam for wrongdoing and evil deeds and hanged by the<br>neck this very day. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She adds a few more red details to this tulip instead, and muses to herself about whether the tulip curtains might not be one step too far in the florescence of their home. There is garishness to it, Margaretha thinks, especially as the tulip has just now become such a ridiculous craze.<br><br>When they had moved into this mansion it was just a bit of silliness. There was a gable stone with a tulip just above their front door and so when he&#x2019;d purchased the carriage for his nightly house calls, he had a tulip painted on its side. Soon enough he became known around the town as Dr. Tulp, and the name stuck. He eventually adopted the name instead of his original, Claes Pieterszoon. After all, there were already a few Pieterszoons in town but only one Tulp.<br><br>Since then, friends and grateful patients often arrive at the house of Tulp with tulip-shaped gifts: tulip vases and tulip dishes, tulip-shaped silver cups, and actual tulips, too, sent from wealthier patients in earthenware vases with many small spouts, which the servants arrange on mantels positioned beneath oil paintings they&#x2019;d been given, too, of tulip bouquets. All these beautiful flowers signify love and respect, Margaretha knows, but every once in a while she<br>can&#x2019;t help feeling she resides, not in a home but in a tulip nursery. She draws the needle through the fabric until it stops.<br><br>Her husband has paced away again, but now he is moving toward her. Margaretha isn&#x2019;t listening exactly, and he has noticed. She hopes he will not take it personally, but she can see that he is agitated, looking for some way to capture her attention. He flips through the pages of his manuscript. Seeming as though he has a new idea, he shifts the papers from one hand to the other, then raises his free hand and begins to gesticulate. He&#x2019;s making a strange movement, rotating his wrist in a somewhat comical twirl, his index finger pointed toward the ceiling.<br><br>&#x201c;Observe the motion of my right hand,&#x201d; he tries. &#x201c;The hand, with its opposable thumb, as the great Galenus has revealed to us, is unique to mankind. To what do we owe to this appendage that sets us apart in form from all other barbarous creatures and brutes?&#x201d;<br><br>He pauses to address her. &#x201c;I have heard tell that the chimpanzee may also have opposable thumbs, though it is not yet confirmed. I wonder if I should mention this? Or does it confuse the point?&#x201d; He muses to himself, drawing his hand across his beard, and then raising his hand again.<br><br>She suppresses a smile that wants very badly to form on her lips as her husband&#x2019;s hand continues to histrionically twirl in the air, like some grandiloquent rhetorician of the Egelantier&#x2019;s. He doesn&#x2019;t seem to notice, but he abruptly paces away from her, dropping his head and muttering something to himself. He holds his fist to his forehead and remains silent for some time. She looks down to check the red detailing, which has gone amiss.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s quite fascinating that we associate so many negative things with the left hand?&#x201d; his wife observes idly, after the silence has gone on for a while. &#x201c;Think of it: the Latin <i>sinister</i>, which you use so often in your speech, for the left hand, means &#x2018;evil or inauspicious,&#x2019; &#x2018;foreboding.&#x2019; And when someone is left-handed, we fear they have powers of witchery.&#x201d;<br><br>She glances up to see his exasperated expression, before he drops his arms to his sides and some papers flutter to the floor. &#x201c;My love, are you paying any attention at all?&#x201d; He shakes the remaining pages of the manuscript at her. &#x201c;I must memorize the speech by this evening. So far, I have not even completed the writing. I shall embarrass myself and our whole household.&#x201d;<br><br>Margaretha takes in the plaintive look in her husband&#x2019;s eyes.

With heads raised and swaying, alert as cobras, the snakes writhed their dry skins upon each other, as snakes like doing in lovemaking, with the added novelty of caressing soft, smooth, moist human skin.<br>Maud and Fergus were deliciously pleased with themselves.<br>The snakes seemed to be tickled, too.<br>We were enchanted. Everyone was in love.<br>Then Maud drew down off Fergus&#x2019;s shoulder, as off a tie rack, a peculiarly lumpy snake and told me to look inside.<br>Inside the double-hinged jaw, a frog&#x2019;s green webbed hind feet were being drawn, like a diver&#x2019;s, very slowly as if into deepest waters.<br>Perhaps thinking I might be considering rescue, Maud said, Don&#x2019;t. Frog is already elsewhere.&#x201d;<br><br> Feathering<br><br>Yesterday she took down from the attic an old lumpy tea-colored pillow stained with drool, hair grease, night sweats, or what !<br>which many heads may have waked upon in the dark, and lain there motionless, eyes open, wondering at the strangeness within themselves took it and ripped out the stitching at one end, making of it a sack.<br>Standing on a bench in the garden, she plunges a hand into the sack and lifts out a puffy fistful of feathers.<br>A few accidentally spill and drift, and tree swallows appear. She raises the hand holding the feathers straight up over her head, and stands like a god of seedtime about to scatter bits of plenitude, or like herself in a long-ago summer, by a pond, chumming for sunfish with bread crumbs.<br>When the breeze quickens she opens her fist and more of these fluffs near zero on the scale of materiality float free. One of the swallows now looping and whirling about her snatches at a feather, misses, twists round on itself, streaks back, snaps its beak shut on it, and flings itself across the field.<br>Another swallow seizes a feather and flies up, but, flapping and turning, loses it to a third swallow, who soars with it even higher and disappears.<br>After many tosses, misses, parries, catches, she ties off the pillow, ending for now the game they make of it when she&#x2019;s there, the imperative to feather one&#x2019;s nest, which has come down in the tree swallow from the Pliocene. She returns to the house, a slight lurch in her gait not surprising, for she has been so long at play with these acrobatic, daredevil aerialists, she might momentarily have lost the trick of walking on earth.<br><br> Insomniac<br><br>I open my eyes to see how the night is progressing. The clock glows green, the light of the last-quarter moon shines up off the snow into our bedroom.<br>Her portion of our oceanic duvet lies completely flat. The words of the shepherd in Tristan, Waste and empty, the sea,&#x201d; come back to me.<br>Where can she be? Then in the furrow where the duvet overlaps her pillow, a small hank of brown hair shows itself, her marker that she&#x2019;s here, asleep, somewhere down in the dark underneath. Now she rotates herself a quarter turn, from strewn all unfolded on her back to bunched in a Z on her side, with her back to me.<br>I squirm nearer, careful not to break into the immensity of her sleep, and lie there absorbing the astounding quantity of heat a slender body ovens up around itself.<br>Her slow, purring, sometimes snorish, perfectly intelligible sleeping sounds abruptly stop. A leg darts back and hooks my ankle with its foot and draws me closer. Immediately her sleeping sounds resume, telling me: Come, press against me, yes, like that, put your right elbow on my hipbone, perfect, and your right hand at my breasts, yes, that&#x2019;s it, now your left arm, which has become extra, stow it somewhere out of the way, good.<br>Entangled with each other so, unsleeping one, together we will outsleep the night.&#x201d;<br><br>Copyright � 2006 by Galway Kinnell.

Their stories, brought viscerally to life by Kaufmann, provide unprecedented insights into how Africans came to be in Tudor England, what they did there and how they were treated.

She has appeared on Sky News, the BBC and Al Jazeera, and she&#x2019;s written for The Times, Guardian and BBC History Magazine. She lives in London."&#x2018;Splendid...an excellent study of this hitherto silent minority." (<i><b><i>- Sunday Times (UK)</i></b></i>)<br><br>"The very concept of black Tudors may sound unlikely, but in this highly readable yet intensively researched book, Kaufmann, senior research fellow at the University of London&#x2019;s Institute of Commonwealth Studies, makes clear that people of African descent were residing in England centuries before the postwar Windrush generation and were not necessarily enslaved. By examining in detail the lives of 10 previously obscure men and women, Kaufmann depicts the great diversity of their experiences in 16th- and early-17th-century England. John Blanke, a trumpeter to Henry VII, lived at the Tudor court and earned twice the annual wage of a white agricultural laborer, while mariner John Anthony&#x2019;s travels took him to Virginia just as the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colony. The exotically named Cattelena of Almondsbury was an unmarried African woman who managed to make a life for herself in rural Gloucestershire. Kaufman also persuasively argues that the enslavement of Africans emerged as a response to the socioeconomic conditions of England&#x2019;s Caribbean and North American colonies, rather than as an inevitable result of a supposedly inherent racism within early modern English culture. Kaufmann&#x2019;s crucial contention, in conjunction with her lively prose and fascinating microhistories, should draw some well-deserved attention."

Kaufmann&#x2019;s greatest skill is her ability to fill in the background on every topic that arises, from piracy to silk-weaving to brothels to Anglo-Moroccan diplomacy...In the hands of a lesser writer this would be mere padding with secondary material, but she investigates every subject in the same depth... a fascinating book, which brings a sadly neglected part of our history to life, and grinds no ideological axes in the process. Five Stars." (<i><b><i>-- Sunday Times (UK)</i></b></i>)<br><br>"Miranda Kaufmann&#x2019;s intricately researched and brilliantly written new book pieces together fragments from the archives to reconstruct the lives of ten black Tudors. And what lives they are: a sailor, a silk weaver and a salvage diver who swam to the wreck of the Mary Rose. Then there is John Blanke, a trumpeter to the Tudor court who was witness to the coronation of Henry VIII. Through these biographies Kaufmann paints a wider panorama of a Renaissance England that was globally aware and in contact with Africa and her people. This is history on the cutting edge of archival research, but accessibly written and alive with human details and warmth. Black Tudors is a critical book that allows us to better understand an era of our national past that fascinates us like no other." (<i><b>&#x2015;David Olusoga, author of <i>Black and British: A Forgotten History</i></b></i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Tudor England&#x2019;s legendary history is a rich locus in the popular imagination. Full of pageantry and larger-than-life personalities, the period is a favorite of the Anglophilic world. But what if that seemingly monolithic world was also black? Miranda Kaufmann&#x2019;s THE BLACK TUDORS: The Untold Story combs historical records and reveals that, in fact, it was. Kaufmann looks at surviving documentation and reveals the African men and women who were present in England as full members of society, filling a variety of roles, collecting wages, and functioning autonomously. Over ten chapters, Kaufmann&#x2019;s vignettes interpret individuals&#x2019; lives within their historical moments. Yet, the historical record is not limited to Kaufmann&#x2019;s ten; appearing alongside the chapters&#x2019; main characters are others whose presence is no less fascinating for only appearing scantly in historical records. For a modern audience acculturated to thinking of Africans in the West as either enslaved or altogether absent, the picture that emerges challenges the centrality of whiteness and slavery in the Tudor period. Kaufmann takes pains to situate England on the national stage as a minor nation emerging from civil war and fighting to be acknowledged at the international level. Tudors were fascinated with North Africa and heavily invested in trading alliances and cultural exchange with African sovereigns, she reveals. Although hierarchical and heavily dependent on servants, Tudor society didn&#x2019;t have slaves, a precedent so well known that slaves of several nations schemed their way to England in a bid for freedom. Whether with Edward Swarthye, a black porter, delivering Tudor justice when he whips a white servant, or the suggestion that Anne Cobbie, the &#x201c;tawny moor with soft skin,&#x201d; might have been a literary inspiration, Kaufmann&#x2019;s THE BLACK TUDORS concentrates on individuals who are enmeshed in the historical narrative and effectively places them right back where they&#x2019;ve always belonged.&#x201d; (<i><b> - Foreword Reviews </b></i>)<br><br>"A thought-provoking account of 10 remarkable people, and a valuable corrective to some unthinking assumptions about both Tudor society and the role of racial minorities in English history." <b><i>-- Times Higher Education (UK)</i></b><br><br>"Who knew that a diver from West Africa worked to salvage Henry VIII&#x2019;s flagship the Mary Rose? Based on a wealth of original research, Miranda Kaufmann&#x2019;s <i>Black Tudors</i> restores the black presence to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England in all its lively detail. Africans lived and worked not as slaves but as independent agents, from mariners to silk weavers, women and men, prince and prostitute. <i>Black Tudors</i> challenges assumptions about ethnic identity and racism in Tudor England. It will be required reading for anyone interested in new directions in Tudor history." (<i><b>- Dr John Cooper, Senior Lecturer in History, University of York, and author of <i>The Queen&#x2019;s Agent</i></b></i>)<br><br>"Miranda Kaufman&#x2019;s <b>The Black Tudors</b>, grounded in extensive and impeccable archival research, presents an evocative and convincing picture of the lives of real men and women of black African descent in Renaissance England. Concentrating on ten strikingly varied individuals &#x2013; from a royal trumpeter to a silk-weaver &#x2013; Kaufman persuasively argues that Africans who came to England this era were able to find a meaningful place in English society, not only in London, Southampton, and Bristol but also in rural areas. Drawing on parish records, legal cases, letters, visual images, and her broad knowledge of Tudor-era economic history and global mercantile expansion, Kaufman dispels the myth that the black Britons of this era existed only at the very upper or lower margins of society. Each of her ten individuals, who are cleverly linked to the records of many others, is vividly brought to life through a discussion of their goals, their labor, and their vicissitudes, and set within the complex social, political, economic, and religious history of the period. The book is a brilliant example of how to use the most detailed kind of archival data to present a broadly accessible picture of the past, and one which has enormous relevance to the present controversies about immigration and diversity." (<i><b>&#x2015;Paul Kaplan, Professor of Art History at SUNY, Purchase</b></i>)<br><br>"The presence of Africans and their descendants in Europe is a subject that has recently received a lot of attention from scholars who are discovering much more diversity in the Middle Ages than was once believed. Miranda Kaufmann&#x2019;s book is a splendid addition to this literature, meticulously researched and well written. She has managed to recover the stories of a remarkably large number of medieval people of African descent, and in surprising places, not just as servants or slaves, but also as skilled tradespeople and even people of substance. Kaufmann&#x2019;s lively prose rests on a solid base of painstaking and far reaching documentation, enough for any historian to admire."

He has written articles on de Kooning, Kline, Estes, and many others, and curated the 1980 traveling exhibitions of Frank Klines color paintings.<br><br>Introduction<br> <br>Willem de Kooning is always pushing us around, making us change our minds just when we think we finally have his art figured out. As the most venerated, yet still misunderstood and upbraided exponent of Abstract Expressionism, he continues to put stringent demands on himself as an artist and on his audience, not merely as viewers, but as participants in his creative act. In a 1958 interview with Thomas B. Hess, the highly perceptive critic, editor, and champion of de Koonings work, the artist remarked: "I was reading Kierkegaard and I came across the phrase To be purified is to will one thing. It made me sick." Constantly seeking visual predicaments, de Kooning complicates them still further, thereby affirming as an ethical decision the refusal to accept any one approach as the only possible solution--even for his own art.<br> <br>Born in Holland in 1904--his surname in Dutch literally means "the king"--de Kooning had an early education that was both practical and academic, a duality that has characterized his career ever since. As a teenager he was apprenticed to a commercial art and decorating firm, yet he also spent eight years at the Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts and Techniques. By the time he sailed for the United States in 1926, he had matured as a skilled craftsman and was developing as an eclectic intellectual.<br> <br>Expecting to find no art in America, he came here "feeling that this was where an individual could get places and become well off, if he worked hard; while art, naturally, was in Europe." Working first as a house painter in Hoboken, New Jersey, he soon learned that America had artists too. "There was Greenwich Village; there was a whole tradition in painting and in poetry." Indigenous to that tradition was artists poverty. Even though he worked for the Federal Arts Project in 1935 and won a commission to design a mural for the Hall of Pharmacy at the 1939 Worlds Fair, poverty was a persistent threat. Among other odd jobs, he designed window displays for A. S. Beck Shoe Stores. (At one point he came up with a "Stepping in Style" theme, incorporating a series of steps.) He also painted features and clothing on flat, planklike mannequins, finishing them quite rapidly--a dozen or two in a day. An early friend, the photographer Rudolph Burckhardt, recalls that de Kooning turned down a $100-per-week commercial art job in Philadelphia. "He said hed rather be poor in New York than rich in Philadelphia." Burckhardt also remembers de Koonings refusing to open the door to his loft at 147 West Twenty-first Street in the mid-1930s. "To get in, you had to shout through the door so that Bill would know it wasnt the landlord." When asked how things were going in those late Depression years, de Koonings reply was an oft-repeated, "Im struggling."<br> <br>Indeed, not until the mid-1950s did de Koonings financial situation improve through the sale of his art. No one was clamoring to buy the Women in the infamous 1953 show at the Sidney Janis Gallery; twenty-one years later, the National Gallery of Australia paid $850,000 for Woman V. De Koonings commercial success is most significant because it enables him to devote himself to art without the once time-consuming problem of making ends meet. "Its terrific. . . I enjoy my life so much now because I can stay here [in The Springs, near East Hampton]. I can paint all the time. I dont have to do anything else." And, indeed, making art has become his predominant activity--he paints every day. "The studio is his universe now."<br> <br>De Koonings knowledge of artists and writers is extensive. For him, Michelangelo is "a force of nature," while El Greco remains perhaps the most modern of all old masters. De Kooning has read Dostoevski, Marcel Proust, Henry James, Mark Twain, and William Faulkner, who at one time was a "real passion" in his life. From time to time he rereads his philosophical mentor, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who has become for de Kooning a kind of "security blanket." De Koonings self-effacing erudition won him respect from other first-generation Abstract Expressionists in the 1940s and 50s. His range of interests and ability to articulate his ideas distinguished him from Jackson Pollock, for example, who was once described by a fellow painter, John Ferren, as the ultimate "Ugh artist."<br> <br>The de Kooning-Pollock relationship is affectionately summarized in de Koonings reminiscence: "He was it. A couple times he told me, You know more, but I feel more. I was jealous of him--his talent. But he was a remarkable person. Hed do things that were so terrific." In reference to the battle for abstract art fought by New York artists shortly after World War II, de Koonings famous comment, "Jackson Pollock broke the ice," expressed the abrupt, intense, and irrevocable nature of Pollocks achievement. However, considering his own work during the last thirty years, de Kooning seems only to have paused momentarily, recognized Pollocks apocalyptic breakthrough, and then resumed working in his independent, yet inclusive way. He has sworn allegiance to neither figural imagery nor abstraction, but has extended and at times fused both modes.<br> <br>Meyer Schapiro likens de Kooning to a mathematician, working in a highly intuitive way with very strong personal reactions. Rejecting a "proof," or style, he poses a new problem and starts all over again. Yet, Schapiro adds, "de Kooning has the simplicity of a craftsman. He respects skill. For that reason, hes always admired commercial artists, those who are not original." This attitude is related to de Koonings ongoing desire to master totally whatever medium he works in: oil, enamel, pencil, pastel, charcoal, and, between 1969 and 1974, clay, which he modeled into pieces that were subsequently cast in bronze or polyester resin. No other Abstract Expressionist has wrestled so frequently and strenuously with so many distinct painting and drawing techniques. De Kooning has sometimes taken them on all at once--as in the figure/landscapes of the late 1960s--not simply to show off his skills, but to amplify the content of his art. And its meaning, its nonformal content, is as extensive as his techniques: ambivalent, somber, frightening, yet at other times joyous, playful, witty, ribald.<br> <br>De Koonings influence, direct and indirect, has been enormous. Major art of the last forty years cannot be even superficially surveyed without focusing on his monumental series. Woman I is as much a symbol of mid-twentieth-century America as Edouard Manets Olympia was a scandalous Venus in 1865 Paris or Marcel Duchamps Nude Descending a Staircase a puzzle hopelessly gone to pieces at the 1913 Armory Show. But de Koonings other Women, as well as his black and white abstractions, his "abstract landscapes" of 1957-63, and his recent sensual abstractions casually yet specifically reflecting the East Hampton environment also qualify as conspicuous landmarks in the history of twentieth-century art. To be sure, not every work in these series is a masterpiece, but de Koonings ability to achieve high quality is prodigious. As artists of his generation had to contend with the promethean Picasso, todays artists have to work their way around de Kooning, or consciously turn their backs on him and walk away. Avowing de Kooning as a paradigm of freedom and dedication for all contemporary artists, regardless of personal style or cause, Jim Dine may say it best: "I love de Kooning most as a fact that he exists for all of us, as our most profound painter, I think."</p><h2>Isle of Woman (Geodyssy, Book 1)</h2><p>A magnificent saga of passion, heroism, and survival, Piers Anthony's <i>Isle of Woman</i> is a tale like no other ever written.

Three sets of footprints extended about seventy-five feet, going north, before being eradicated by erosion. The shape of the prints and pattern of pressures are typically human. These folk walked like men. The largest may have been male, about five feet tall, weighing perhaps a hundred pounds. The next may have been female, a little over three feet tall, perhaps fifty pounds. The third was a small child. These were made by folk called</i> Australopithecus afarensis--<i>never mind the pronunciation, which is changing from right to wrong--one of whom the anthropologists called Lucy. They have no names and no real language, just a collection of a few useful words. They may seem more like apes than men, at this stage, but that may be deceptive</i>.<br>* * *<br>They came near the fierce mountain and saw the mountain's breath spread across the plain, turning it gray. It was safe to cross, because the mountain was not roaring today, but it was nevertheless a marvel.<br>The man walked straight ahead, intent on his mission: to find something to eat He was big and strong, and his fur was thick and even, showing his health. The woman followed just behind, keeping a wary eye on the child. Though she was much smaller than the man, her fur too was sleek and her body lithe. Her chest was flat, signaling her fertility, for she had weaned her son a year ago. She also gazed around, fascinated by the changed scene.<br>It was just at the end of the dry season. The creatures of the plain had grazed the grass down to the roots and moved on. Soon the big rains would come; already there were light showers. Meanwhile the mountain sent out its breath, which resembled the smoke of a great fire when it emerged, and the ash of that fire when it settled to the ground. She saw the tracks of animals in it: birds, rabbits, antelopes and even giraffes. A recent shower had made little holes in the powder wherever the drops struck. Some tracks had already been covered, and also some beetles. She saw a deserted bird's egg, and the outline of animal dung dusted with gray.<br>The child took to the powder immediately. He stretched forth his little legs and stepped in the new prints made by the adults. Sometimes he went to the side, making his own little prints, then returned to the safety of his father's tracks. He chortled. The woman smiled, taking pleasure in his pleasure.<br>She heard something. She turned to her left and paused, listening and looking. It was only guinea fowl, spooked by their approach.<br>The man grunted peremptorily, and the woman resumed her motion. They passed on beyond the ash-covered region, and the ground resumed its normal colors.<br>They were in luck; some distance farther along they found a patch of ripe gourds. The plant had been withered by the mountain's breath, but the fruits remained firm. The man cried out, and others of their band came to gather the food. The man picked up several, and the woman took two more, and the child one. They carried these back to the band's camp.<br>The woman and the child began to tire, so the woman employed a familiar device: she made a grunt of sexual suggestion. The man reacted as expected: he set down his burden, allowing her and the child to do the same, and drew her into him for a bout of copulation. The other members of the tribe paused, considering; then several others paired off, liking the notion. Sex was always a satisfactory interlude.<br>The woman relaxed, letting the man support her. He held her upright, facing him, her feet off the ground. He sniffed her genital region, excited by the odors there. Then he let her slide down to make contact with his erect penis. Most creatures approached their females from the rear, but the upright posture enabled these ones to be frontal if they wished, and often they did wish it, liking variety. The woman was like a doll in his embrace, allowing him any liberty he chose to take. It had been several hours since their last coupling, so he was quite amenable to her suggestion. He bounced her around, squeezed her, and kissed her fur as his member drove deep into her. This might have seemed like rough play, but she was tough and he was vigorous rather than violent.<br>By the time he was done, both the woman and the child were rested. They picked up their burdens and resumed their trek. The other couples were also breaking up, satisfied. Sex had no significance beyond the pleasure of the moment and the continuing association it signaled.<br>They came to the tree where the woman's sister labored, watched by other women of the band. They reached her as the great brightness of the sun settled behind a distant hill, setting the clouds ablaze. The sister was of similar size, with smooth tight fur, but differed in two respects. Her breasts were prominent, their nipples poking out through the fur of her chest. And she was sexually nonreceptive, because she had already been fertilized. This was why the other woman was kept busier now: it was, in part, her job to protect the security of the family by making sure their man had no reason to respond to any outside woman. Had the family lived apart from others of their kind there would have been little problem, but in a band with several receptive females fidelity could be strained. Two women were enough, in this case, because their cycles of availability were complementary: while one was pregnant, birthing and nursing, the other was receptive. By the time her sister got a baby started, the original woman was ready again. In that manner the two kept the man to themselves, and benefited from his superior ability to forage and to protect them from both outsiders and other men in the tribe. They shared food, when necessary, with others, but not sex or child caring.<br>They were part of a band that traveled as a unit, but when children grew up the males went out to join other bands and mate with their women. A man was entitled to as many women as he could succeed in taking and keeping from other men. The women in turn preferred to have as much of a man to themselves as they could, and sisters or close friends cooperated in that design. It was almost impossible for a single woman to hold a single man, because of her infertile periods while nursing her small children, but two or three cooperating women could manage it.<br>Half the babies were lost in their first year, and some fell prey to accidents or illness thereafter, so it was necessary to sire several to be sure one would survive. On average, a woman was sexually receptive about half the time. She was less fertile than other female creatures, so that it could take her a year to conceive. That was what made it possible for only two women to keep one male, if they were correctly phased. If both conceived at the same time, they would lose him, because neither would be able to entice him with sex. Neither the man nor the woman thought of it exactly this way, but this was the mode that enabled the fledgling species to survive.<br>Indeed, the sister's labor was complete; she held a furry baby boy. There was a red mark on his little forehead, but it did not matter, for he was healthy. Now the man had two sons, by two sister women. It was good.<br>* * *<br><i>In this manner the tracks leading toward the full human species proceeded. Yes, they are our ancestors. Normally when the male is considerably larger than the female, he has more than one mate, so their social conventions were probably not the same as ours. Three million years can change things, however. Because he was born as the blazing sun set, and had a birthmark sharing this color, we shall call the new baby Blaze</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1993 by Piers Anthony Jacob</p><h2>North Woods River: The St. Croix River in Upper Midwest History (Wisconsin Land and Life)</h2><p>The St. Croix River, the free-flowing boundary between Wisconsin and Minnesota, is a federally protected National Scenic Riverway. The area&#x2019;s first recorded human inhabitants were the Dakota Indians, whose lands were transformed by fur trade empires and the loggers who called it the &#x201c;river of pine.&#x201d; A patchwork of farms, cultivated by immigrants from many countries, followed the cutover forests.

His examples range throughout the rich and heterogeneous tapestry of the earth's surface: the dramatic variations of mountainous topography, the undulating ground and crevices of level limestone karst, and the subtle realm of sand dunes. He describes the ongoing evolutionary consequences of the geology-plant interface and the often underestimated role of geology in shaping climate.</p><p>Kruckeberg explores the fundamental connection between plants and geology, including the historical roots of geobotany, the reciprocal relations between geology and other environmental influences, geomorphology and its connection with plant life, lithology as a potent selective agent for plants, and the physical and biological influences of soils. Special emphasis is given to the responses of plants to exceptional rock types and their soils--serpentines, limestones, and other azonal (exceptional) substrates. Edaphic ecology, especially of serpentines, has been his specialty for years.</p><p>Kruckeberg's research fills a significant gap in the field of environmental science by connecting the conventionally separated disciplines of the physical and biological sciences.<i>Geology and Plant Life</i> is the result of more than forty years of research into the question of why certain plants grow on certain soils and certain terrain structures, and what happens when this relationship is disrupted by human agents. It will be useful to a wide spectrum of professionals in the natural sciences: plant ecologists, paleobiologists, climatologists, soil scientists, geologists, geographers, and conservation scientists, as well as serious amateurs in natural history.</p></p><p>Arthur R.

His father has been promised land if he will join the Texas settlers fighting against Mexico. When Jeff and his friend Josh take food to the undersupplied army at Goliad, they choose to stay. Josh is killed in battle, and Jeff's father is among those killed by Mexican soldiers. The plot moves so fast that it desensitizes readers to these horrific events; Jeff seems to recover from these incidences too quickly. Dialogue is sometimes awkward and character development slim. Yet some complex aspects are treated quite well. Wisler goes a long way to illuminate the efforts of the Texans, showing how truly disorganized they were, which made for greater bravery in the face of the odds. He shows Jeff's growing understanding of the plight of the Tejanos, Mexicans living in Texas, whose lives are disrupted by these settlers insisting on independence. Wisler also captures the bloodthirsty desire for revenge that led soldiers to kill Mexicans who gave themselves up at the battle of San Jacinto, where the Mexican army was finally defeated. In a final note, he gives more information about his sources and provides additional historical facts.

No one in the restaurant can identify the gunman, and local police are sheepishly baffled. That's when Beck takes over the scene and quickly picks through Palmgren's background. What he finds is a web of vice so despicable that it's hard for him to imagine who <i>wouldn't </i>want Palmgren dead, but that doesn't stop him and his team of dedicated detectives from tackling one of their most intriguing cases yet.</p><p>Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo, wife and husband team, wrote ten Martin Beck mysteries, virtually creating the modern police procedural. In addition to the many short stories and novels he wrote, Mr. Wahloo, who died in 1975, wrote numerous radio and television plays and was a reporter for several Swedish newspapers and magazines. Maj Sjowall is also a journalist and poet. She lives in Sweden.1The day was hot and stifling, without a breath of air. There had been a haze quivering in the atmosphere, but now the sky was high and clear, its colors shifting from rose to dusky blue. The sun&#39;s red disk would soon disappear beyond the island of Ven. The evening breeze, which was already rippling the smooth mirror of the Sound, brought weak puffs of agreeable freshness to the streets of Malmo. With the gentle wind came fumes of the rotting garbage and seaweed that had been washed up on Ribersborg Beach and in through the mouth of the harbor into the canals.The city doesn&#39;t resemble the rest of Sweden to a very great degree, largely because of its location. Malmo is closer to Rome than to the midnight sun, and the lights of the Danish coast twinkle along the horizon. And even if many winters are slushy and windblown, summers are just as often long and warm, filled with the song of the nightingale and scents from the lush vegetation of the expansive parks.Which is exactly the way it was that fair summer evening early in July 1969. It was also quiet, calm and quite deserted. The tourists weren&#39;t noticeable to any extent--they hardly ever are. As for the roaming, unwashed hash-smokers, only the first bands had arrived, and not so many more would show up either, since most of them never get past Copenhagen.It was rather quiet even in the big hotel across from the railroad station near the harbor. A few foreign businessmen were deliberating over their reservations at the reception desk. The checkroom attendant was reading one of the classics undisturbed in the depths of the cloakroom. The dimly lit bar contained only a couple of regular customers speaking in low voices and a bartender in a snow-white jacket.In the large eighteenth-century dining room to the right of the lobby there wasn&#39;t much going on either, even if it was somewhat livelier. A few tables were occupied, mostly by people who were sitting alone. The pianist was taking a break. In front of the swinging doors leading to the kitchen stood a waiter, hands behind his back, looking contemplatively out of the big open windows, probably lost in thoughts of the sand beaches not too far away.A dinner party of seven, a well dressed and solemn gathering of varying sexes and ages, was sitting in the back of the dining room. Their table was cluttered with glasses and fancy dishes, surrounded by champagne coolers. The restaurant personnel had discreetly withdrawn, for the host had just risen to speak.He was a tall man in late middle age, with a dark-blue shantung suit, iron gray hair and a deep suntan. He spoke calmly and skillfully, modulating his voice in subtly humorous phrases. The other six at the table sat watching him quietly; only one of them was smoking.Through the open windows came the sounds of passing cars, trains switching tracks at the station across the canal, a switchyard that is the largest in northern Europe, the abrupt hoarse tooting of a boat from Copenhagen, and somewhere on the bank of the canal a girl giggling.This was the scene that soft warm Wednesday in July, at approximately eight-thirty in the evening. It&#39;s essential to use the expression &#34;approximately,&#34; for no one ever managed to pin down the exact time when it happened. On the other hand, what did happen is quite easy to describe.A man came in through the main entrance, cast a glance at the reception desk with the foreign businessmen and the uniformed attendant, passed the checkroom and the long narrow lobby outside of the bar, and walked into the dining room calmly and resolutely, with steps that weren&#39;t notably rapid. There was nothing remarkable about this man so far. No one looked at him; he did not bother to look around either.He passed the Hammond organ, the grand piano and the buffet with its array of glistening delicacies and continued past the two large pillars supporting the ceiling. With the same resolve he walked directly toward the party in the corner, where the host stood talking with his back turned to him. When the man was about five steps away, he thrust his right hand inside his suit coat. One of the women at the table looked at him, and the speaker half turned his head to see what was distracting her. He gave the approaching man a quick, indifferent glance, and started to turn back toward his guests, without a second&#39;s interruption in the comments he was making. At the same instant the newcomer pulled out a steel-blue object with a fluted butt and a long barrel, aimed carefully and shot the speaker in the head. The report was not shattering. It sounded more like the peaceful pop of a rifle in a shooting gallery at a fair.The bullet struck the speaker just behind the left ear, and he fell forward onto the table, his left cheek in the crenelated mashed potatoes around an exquisite fish casserole a la Frans Suell.Sticking the weapon into his pocket, the gunman turned sharply to the right, walked the few steps to the nearest open window, placed his left foot on the sill, swung himself over the low window, stepped into the flower box outside, hopped down onto the sidewalk and disappeared.At the table three windows away a diner in his fifties became rigid and stared with amazement, a glass of whisky halfway to his mouth. In front of him was a book that he had been pretending to read.The man with the suntan and the dark-blue shantung suit was not dead.Stirring, he said, &#34;Ow! It hurts.&#34;Dead people don&#39;t usually complain. Besides, it didn&#39;t even look as if he were bleeding.2Per Mansson was sitting in his bachelor den on Regementsgatan, talking to his wife on the telephone. He was a Detective Inspector with the Malmo police force, and although he was married, he lived as a bachelor five days out of the week. For more than ten years he&#39;d spent every free weekend with his wife--an arrangement which had so far satisfied both of them.He cradled the receiver with his left shoulder while he mixed a Gripenberger with his right hand. It was his favorite drink, consisting simply of a jigger of gin, crushed ice and grape soda in a big tumbler.His wife, who&#39;d been to the movies, was telling him the plot of Gone With the Wind.It took some time, but Mansson listened patiently, because as soon as she had finished the story he planned to ward off their usual weekend get-together with the excuse that he had to work. Which was a lie.It was twenty minutes after nine in the evening.Mansson was sweating in spite of his light clothing--a fishnet undershirt and checkered shorts. He had closed the balcony door at the beginning of the conversation so that he wouldn&#39;t be disturbed by the rumble of the traffic from the street. Although the sun had long ago sunk behind the roofs of the buildings across the street, it was very warm in the room.He stirred his drink with a fork, which he was embarrassed to admit had been either stolen or taken by accident from a restaurant called &#34;Oversten.&#34; Mansson wondered if a person could take a fork by accident and said, &#34;Yes, I see. It was Leslie Howard then who . . . No, huh? Clark Gable? Uh-hmm . . .&#34;Five minutes later she&#39;d got to the end. He delivered his white lie and hung up.The telephone rang. Mansson didn&#39;t answer immediately. He was off work and wanted to keep it that way. He slowly drained his Gripenberger. Watching the evening sky darken, he lifted the receiver and answered, &#34;Mansson.&#34;&#34;This is Nilsson. That was a helluva long conversation. I&#39;ve been trying to get you for half an hour.&#34;Nilsson was an Assistant Detective, on duty that night at the central police station on Davidshall Square. Mansson sighed.&#34;Well?&#34; he said. &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;&#34;A man has been shot in the dining room at the Savoy. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have to ask you to get over there.&#34;The glass was empty but still cold. Mansson picked it up and rolled it against his forehead with the palm of his hand.&#34;Is he dead?&#34; he asked.&#34;Don&#39;t know,&#34; said Nilsson.&#34;Can&#39;t you send Skacke?&#34;&#34;He&#39;s off. Impossible to get hold of. I&#39;ll keep looking for him. Backlund is there now, but you probably ought to . . .&#34;Mansson gave a start and put down the glass.&#34;Backlund? Okay, I&#39;ll leave right away,&#34; he said.He promptly called a taxi, then put the receiver on the table. While dressing, he listened to the rasping voice from the receiver mechanically repeating the words &#34;Taxi Central, one moment please&#34; until his call was finally put through to the operator.Outside the Savoy Hotel several police cars were carelessly parked, and two patrolmen were blocking the entrance from a growing crowd of curious evening strollers jammed together at the bottom of the stairs.Mansson took in the scene as he paid for the cab, put the receipt in his pocket, observed that one of the patrolmen was being rather brusque and reflected that it wouldn&#39;t be long before Malmo&#39;s police force had as bad a reputation as their colleagues in Stockholm.He said nothing, however, only nodded as he walked past the uniformed patrolmen into the lobby. It was noisy there now. The hotel&#39;s entire staff had gathered and were chatting with each other and with some customers streaming out of the grill. Several policemen completed the picture. They seemed at a loss, unfamiliar with the surroundings. Evidently no one had told them how to act or what to expect.Mansson was a big man in his fifties. He was dressed casually in dacron pants and sandals, with his shirt out. He took a toothpick from his breast pocket, pulled off the paper wrapper and stuck it in his mouth. As he chewed, he methodically took stock of the situation. The toothpick was American, menthol-flavored; he&#39;d picked it up on the train ferry Malmohus, which provides such things for its passengers.Standing by the door leading to the large dining room was a patrolman named Elofsson, whom Mansson thought was a little smarter than the others.He walked over to him and said, &#34;What&#39;s the story?&#34;&#34;Looks like someone&#39;s been shot.&#34;&#34;Have you had any instructions?&#34;&#34;Not a word.&#34;&#34;What&#39;s Backlund doing?&#34;&#34;Questioning witnesses.&#34;&#34;Where&#39;s the man who was shot?&#34;&#34;At the hospital, I guess.&#34;Elofsson turned slightly red. Then he said, &#34;The ambulance got here before the police, obviously.&#34;Mansson sighed and went into the dining room.Backlund was standing by the table with the gleaming silver tureens questioning a waiter. He was an elderly man with glasses and ordinary features. Somehow he&#39;d managed to become a First Assistant Detective. He was holding his notebook open in his hand, busily taking notes. Mansson stopped within hearing distance, but said nothing.&#34;And at what time did this happen?&#34;&#34;Uh, about eight-thirty.&#34;&#34;About?&#34;&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know for sure.&#34;&#34;In other words, you don&#39;t know what time it was.&#34;&#34;No, I don&#39;t.&#34;&#34;Rather odd,&#34; said Backlund.&#34;What?&#34;&#34;I said, it seems rather odd. You have a wrist watch, don&#39;t you?&#34;&#34;Of course.&#34;&#34;And there is a clock on the wall over there, if I&#39;m not mistaken.&#34;&#34;Yes, but . . .&#34;&#34;But what?&#34;&#34;Both of them are wrong. Anyway, I didn&#39;t think of looking at the clock.&#34;Backlund appeared overwhelmed by the response. He put down the pad and pencil and began to clean his glasses. He took a deep breath, grabbed the notebook and started writing again.&#34;Even though you had two clocks at your disposal, you still didn&#39;t know what time it was.&#34;&#34;Well, kind of.&#34;&#34;We&#39;ve got no use for &#39;kind of&#39; answers.&#34;&#34;But the clocks aren&#39;t synchronized. Mine&#39;s fast, and the clock over there&#39;s slow.&#34;Backlund consulted his Ultratron. &#34;Odd,&#34; he said, writing something down.Mansson wondered what.&#34;So, you were standing here when the criminal walked by?&#34;&#34;Yes.&#34;&#34;Can you give me as full a description as possible?&#34;&#34;I didn&#39;t really get a good look at him.&#34;&#34;You didn&#39;t see the gunman?&#34; said Backlund, startled.&#34;Well, yes, when he climbed out the window.&#34;&#34;What did he look like?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t know. It was pretty far away, and that table was hidden by the pillar.&#34;&#34;You mean you don&#39;t know what he looked like?&#34;&#34;Not really.&#34;&#34;How was he dressed then?&#34;&#34;In a brown sport coat, I think.&#34;&#34;Think.&#34;&#34;Yeah. I only saw him for a second.&#34;&#34;What else did he have on? Try pants, for example.&#34;&#34;Sure, he had pants on.&#34;&#34;Are you certain?&#34;&#34;Well, it sure would have seemed a little . . . like you said, odd, otherwise. If he hadn&#39;t had any pants on, I mean.&#34;Backlund wrote furiously. Mansson started chewing on the other end of the toothpick and quietly said, &#34;Say, Backlund?&#34;The other man turned around and glared.&#34;I&#39;m in the middle of questioning an important witness . . .&#34;He broke off and said sullenly, &#34;Oh, so it&#39;s you.&#34;&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;&#34;A man was shot in here,&#34; said Backlund in great earnest. &#34;And you know who?&#34;&#34;No.&#34;&#34;Viktor Palmgren. The corporation president.&#34; Backlund laid heavy stress on the label.&#34;Oh, him,&#34; said Mansson. And thought, this&#39;ll be a helluva time. Aloud he said, &#34;It happened over an hour ago and the gunman climbed out the window and got away.&#34;&#34;It may look that way.&#34;Backlund never took anything for granted.&#34;Why are there six police cars outside?&#34;&#34;I had them close off the area.&#34;&#34;The whole block?&#34;&#34;The scene of the crime,&#34; said Backlund.&#34;Get rid of everybody in uniform,&#34; Mansson said wearily. &#34;It can&#39;t be very pleasant for the hotel to have police swarming around in the foyer and out on the street. Besides, they must be needed more some place else. Then try to get up a description. There has to be a better witness than this guy.&#34;&#34;Naturally, we&#39;ll question everybody,&#34; said Backlund.&#34;All in due time,&#34; said Mansson. &#34;But don&#39;t detain anyone who doesn&#39;t have something crucial to say. Just take names and addresses.&#34;Backlund looked at him suspiciously and said, &#34;What are you planning to do?&#34;&#34;Make some telephone calls,&#34; said Mansson.&#34;Who to?&#34;&#34;The newspapers, to find out what&#39;s happened.&#34;&#34;Was that supposed to be a joke?&#34; said Backlund coldly.&#34;Right,&#34; said Mansson absentmindedly and looked around.Journalists and photographers were roaming around in the dining room. Some of them must have been there long before the police, and one or more had been on the spot in the grill or the bar when the famous shot was fired. Probably. If Mansson&#39;s suspicions proved correct.&#34;But the manual requires . . . ,&#34; Backlund began.</p><h2>Light Lifting</h2><p>Product Description Light Lifting is one of those rare debuts: a breathtakingly good collection of short fiction that heralds the arrival of a significant new talent: a suite of darkly urban, unflinching elegies. The seven stories each encompass a keenly observed, immersive world, and each carries the weight and impact of a novel. They are reminiscent of the work of Alice Munro at her best - rich and deep, merciless and utterly thrilling. MacLeod&#39;s stories are shorn of sentimentality but drenched in an amorphous yearning, an omnipresent sense of loss and peril that seeps into even the happiest moments. &#39;Good Kids&#39;, about a family of four boys and their relationship with the boy who lived briefly in the rental house across the street, exemplifies a sense of sharp nostalgia: &#39;Our sticks were Koho and Sherwood shafts with plastic blades that had been wickedly curved over the front burner of the stove and we usually played with tennis balls that were too small and kept falling down through the grates of the sewer.&#39; These reminiscences are balanced with keen insight into the casual, almost inevitable brutality that even &#39;good&#39; kids are capable of. Despite that underlying sense of sadness, the characters in Light Lifting aren&#39;t adrift. They&#39;re rooted firmly in the real world of work and family. These are elemental stories of work and its bonds, of tragedy and tragedy barely averted, but also of beauty and love and moments of pure transcendence. About the Author Alexander MacLeod was born in Inverness, Cape Breton and raised in Windsor, Ontario. Light Lifting was shortlisted for the Giller Prize, the Commonwealth Prize, two Atlantic Book Awards, and went on to become a Canadian bestseller. MacLeod holds degrees from the universities of Windsor, Notre Dame and McGill, and currently lives in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.</p><p>Two runners race a cargo train through the darkness of a rat-infested tunnel beneath the Detroit River.

An auto worker who loses his family in a car accident is forced to reconsider his relationship with the internal combustion engine. <p></p> <p> Alexander MacLeod is a writer of "ferocious intelligence" and "ferocious physicality" (CTV). <i>Light Lifting,</i> his celebrated first collection, offers us a suite of darkly urban and unflinching elegies that explore the depths of the psyche and channel the subconscious hopes and terrors that motivate us all. These are elemental stories of work and its bonds, of tragedy and tragedy barely averted, but also of beauty, love and fragile understanding.</p>Alexander MacLeod was born in Inverness, Cape Breton and raised in Windsor, Ontario.

Taking in far more than the kitchen, author Elizabeth Collins Cromley explores all areas of food management within the home&#x2015;preparation, cooking, consumption, and disposal. Her food axis implies a network of related spaces above and below ground, both attached to the house and separate from it. Studying the use and interaction of these spaces, and the ways in which their components change (often radically) over time, the author shows how these elements have helped shape the multiple forms of residential architecture in the United States, from the first settlement period to the present.</p><p>Beginning with the earliest&#x2015;and relatively simple&#x2015;houses, Cromley traces changes in food spaces through the years, noting a steady escalation in the number of food-related rooms. Along the way, she considers multiple circumstances that shed light on this evolution, including the role of gender in determining food-space design, the relation of food spaces to nature, and the telling ways in which people and food circulate through kitchens and dining rooms. Because Cromley is interested not only in how designed spaces look but how they are used, she cites a wealth of primary sources&#x2015;autobiographies, travel journals, household diaries, letters, inventories&#x2015;in her exploration of the habits surrounding all aspects of food in the home.</p><p>In addition to designers, preservationists, and architectural historians, this book will interest curious cooks as well as home-dwellers who want to better understand the spaces they inhabit.</p></p><p><p>Elizabeth Collins Cromley is Professor of Architectural History at Northeastern University.

Initially dismissed as dry leaves and an odd Indian drink, these two commodities came to conquer Europe on a scale unsurpassed by any other American resource or product. A fascinating story of contact, exploration, and exchange in the Atlantic world, Sacred Gifts, Profane Pleasures traces the ways in which these two goods of the Americas both changed and were changed by Europe.</p><p>Focusing on the Spanish Empire, Marcy Norton investigates how tobacco and chocolate became material and symbolic links to the pre-Hispanic past for colonized Indians and colonizing Europeans alike. Botanical ambassadors of the American continent, they also profoundly affected Europe. Tobacco, once condemned as proof of Indian diabolism, became the constant companion of clergymen and the single largest source of state revenue in Spain. Before coffee or tea became popular in Europe, chocolate was the drink that energized the fatigued and uplifted the depressed. However, no one could quite forget the pagan past of tobacco and chocolate, despite their apparent Europeanization: physicians relied on Mesoamerican medical systems for their understanding of tobacco; theologians looked to Aztec precedent to decide whether chocolate drinking violated Lenten fasts. </p><p>The struggle of scientists, theologians, and aficionados alike to reconcile notions of European superiority with the fact of American influence shaped key modern developments ranging from natural history to secularization. Norton considers the material, social, and cultural interaction between Europe and the Americas with historical depth and insight that goes beyond the portrayal of Columbian exchange simply as a matter of exploitation, infection, and conquest.</p></p><p>"Chocolate and tobacco will never taste the same. Smokers and chocoholics will understand themselves better, thanks to Marcy Norton�s book, not as victims of their own addictions or indulgences, but as part of a vast, fascinating, and world-shaping episode of the history of cultural exchange."--Felipe Fern�ndez-Armesto, Tufts University, author of Pathfinders: A Global History of Exploration <p></p><p> "Marcy Norton's fascinating, beautifully illustrated, and deeply researched book traces the history of chocolate and tobacco as each crossed the Atlantic in the early modern era. Sacred Gifts, Profane Pleasures draws on a rich and varied array of sources, including artwork, shipping registers, religious treatises, medical manuals, Inquisition records, and poetry. Norton delineates how Iberians emulated and adapted American habits as they sought to fit tobacco and chocolate into their religious worldviews, medical practices, habits of sociability, and economic systems. This original and pathbreaking work deserves a wide readership."--Alison Games, Georgetown University, author of The Web of Empire: British Cosmopolitans in an Age of Expansion, 1560-1660 </p><p> "In Mesoamerica, tobacco was consumed as a paste to apply on the body, as an alkaloid to chew with lime, as a powder to sniff, or as a cigarette to smoke. Chocolate was originally consumed mostly by elites, mixed with corn flour, spices and honey. Marcy Norton deftly shows in Sacred Gifts, Profane Pleasures that European colonizers eventually embraced these patterns of consumption. Norton puts Spain at the center of the narrative on the early modern consumer revolution. She succeeds brilliantly in showing how tobacco and chocolate were consumed in Mesoamerica prior to the European arrival and how the Spaniards and their descendants sought to cleanse these two staples of their pagan, demonic associations."-Jorge Ca�izares-Esguerra, Alice Drysdale Sheffield Professor of History, University of Texas at Austin, author of Puritan Conquistadors</p><p>Marcy Norton is Associate Professor of History at George Washington University.

He uses a new approach based on a fresh reading of the original Greek texts, newly discovered gospels and employs psychology and archetypal studies. </p><p>In this book, Moore shows that Jesus&#x2019; teachings are challenging in a way that is far different from the moralism often associated with him.&nbsp;<b>Writing in the Sand</b> sets forth how we can today live the way of life that Jesus represents, showing that Jesus is a vibrant figure whose teachings can be meaningfully integrated into our twenty-first century intellectual and spiritual lives.&nbsp;Moore also unravels the mystery of Jesus in the past and present, from the hidden and coded texts of the Gospels, and the result will enlighten and delight readers.</p></p><p><b>Thomas Moore</b> is the author of numerous popular spiritual books including the New York Times best seller, <i>Care of the Soul</i>.

How, as Christian faith adjusts to a new culture, should the church confess Christ? <p>"Above All Earthly Pow'rs," the fourth and final volume of the set that began in 1993 with "No Place for Truth," paints a picture of the West in all its complexity, brilliance, and emptiness. As David Wells masterfully depicts it, the postmodern ethos of the West is relativistic, individualistic, therapeutic, and yet remarkably spiritual. Wells unabashedly locates American postmodernism's roots in the last century's waves of immigration &#x2014; waves that, for all their diversity, have brought with them numerous new religions and a cultural relativism born out of confusion and a fear of offense. Wells also carefully differentiates between intellectual and popular postmodernism; while few Americans read Foucault or Derrida, nearly everyone is subject to the permeating flood of TV ads. </p><p>Wells's book culminates in a critique of contemporary evangelicalism aimed at both unsettling and reinvigorating readers. Churches that market themselves as relevant to consumption-oriented postmoderns are indeed swelling in size. But they are doing so, Wells contends, at the expense of the truth of the gospel, as the trappings they adopt come laden with theological consequences. By placing a premium on marketing, the evangelical church is in danger of selling authentic engagement with culture for worldly success. </p><p>Welding extensive cultural analysis with a formidable theological contribution, "Above All Earthly Pow'rs" will grip pastors, educators, and all serious readers concerned about the fate of evangelical Christianity.</p></p><p><p>In our postmodern world, every view has a place at the table but none has the final say.

He has contributed to the <i>VIBE History of Hip Hop</i> and written extensively on reggae and hip hop. Former editor-in-chief of <i>Art &amp; Antiques</i> magazine, he has also contributed to such magazines as <i>Wired, Spin, InStyle, Time Out New York</i>, and <i>Playboy</i>. George Pitts is the award-winning director of photography at <i>VIBE</i> magazine, a position he has held since the magazine's launch. He is also a painter and photographer whose writing and art have appeared in the <i>Partisan Review, the Paris Review, One World, Juxtapose</i>, and the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>.Since 1993, VIBE magazine has documented hip-hop's prodigious rise and constant reinvention. With a foreword by founder Quincy Jones, this 10-year anniversary volume of photos from the publication's archives proves that the image-makers aren't only on the mic-they lurk behind the lens, too. Styles range widely, including Sacha Waldman's luminous, saturated, otherworldly streetscape tableaus of OutKast, Erykah Badu, RZA and Tiny Lister; Dana Lixenberg's simple, lingering portraits of Navajo-kids throwing gang signs, women idling curbside in Cape Town, and the now-iconic wistful Tupac in a bandanna; and Dean Karr's deliriously absurd action shot of Redman and a goose locked in airborne embrace. Editors Kenner and Pitts have organized the collection less by history than by composition-Wesley Snipes's mud-caked profile faces Eve's close-cropped crown; Alicia Keyes stretched across a piano abuts Ricky Martin reclining on a luxury speedboat. Still, a larger trajectory does emerge, mainly that the expressive idiosyncrasy of rap progenitors-quizzical Chuck D, skeptical Flavor Flav, stately, knowing Run-D.M.C.-has given way to the ubiquitous half-lidded, stone-faced glower: the thug pose. Other requisite images: women splayed on cars, women extending their tongues. There are striking departures from type, though, such as Nelly in bejeweled, bent-wrist, and parted-lip ecstasy or the unflinching Voletta Wallace holding a framed portrait of her son, Notorious B.I.G. Brief quotes and snippets from articles complement some of the pictures, such as Rob Kenner's gleeful note that "although Nas dropped out of school in the eighth grade his verses are beginning to be studied in university classes alongside the poetry of T.S. Eliot." 150 full-color photographs. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jocks: True Stories of America&#39;s Gay Male Athletes</h2><p>Profiles several dozen young male athletes who have in most cases &#34;come out&#34; as homosexual to their coaches, teammates, and fellow students, with advice for coaches on dealing with homophobia</p><p>Woog characterizes the athletic locker room as "the largest, dingiest, smelliest closet left in America." He then profiles several dozen men, many still quite young, who have helped dispel at least the <i>closet</i> part of that characterization. Each has acknowledged his homosexuality and, with one poignant exception ("The Suicidal Jock," still adjusting as a college junior), has come out to coaches and teammates, or, if a coach himself, to students. Woog writes vividly about them all, communicating the fulfillment they find in sports as well as the satisfaction they experience in being out. He depicts them as normally complex persons coping with normally complex life situations, one of which is <i>not</i>, however, being turned on by the sight of naked teammates. Besides plenty of soccer players (Woog has coached the sport for 20 years), swimmers, gymnasts, wrestlers, runners, basketballers, hockey players, and even an "impostor," who admits going out for junior-high sports to be near other boys, also appear, and Woog concludes with advice to coaches on dealing with homophobia. <i>Ray Olson</i>Over two dozen personal profiles of high school and college coaches and athletes succinctly and sensitively dispute the contention that "gay jock" is an oxymoron. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Roman Military Equipment: From the Punic Wars to the Fall of Rome</h2><p>This book brings together evidence from all over the Roman Empire to examine the development of Roman military equipment.

Addressing the true nature of this intriguing animal, this resource explores&nbsp;its evolutionary survival, the 23 living species in the world today, and the extinction they face due to habitat intrusion. Also explored are the myths and legends surrounding crocodiles and the&nbsp;vicious reputation they have&nbsp;amongst humans.</p><p><b>Lynne Kelly</b> is an&nbsp;educational consultant in science, mathematics, and computing. She&nbsp;is&nbsp;the author of <i>Avenging Janie </i>and <i>The Skeptic's Guide to the Paranormal</i>.Kelly, an Australian writer and science teacher, gives readers a thorough tour of crocodilian evolution in this lively biological biography. Kelly builds her scientific investigation on a solid cultural foundation, by introducing the crocodile through folk tales of indigenous Australians, Africans, Americans and South Asians; similarly, fossils showing crocodilies have changed very little in more than 200 million years adds relevance to the old stories and weight to the sobering fact that, today, mankind has managed to kill off many crocodilian species that eons of natural selection never could. Among chapters on biology, featuring photos and drawings of characteristic behavior and skeletal structures, Kelly covers the scientific minds who came before her, such as 19th century naturalists Sir Richard Owen and Thomas Huxley ("Darwin's Bulldog"), who feuded famously over still-unresolved taxonomy issues. In addition, Kelly recounts the tales of famous crocodile hunters and infamous attacks on humans by crocodilians, discusses the continuing demand for crocodile hides and meat and investigates crocodile farming in relation to other types of animal husbandry. Kelly's treatment is clever, entertaining and complete, making this a fine read and a great example of species history done right. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Included in the party was Alan Paton, acclaimed author of Cry, the Beloved Country, chairman of the newly-formed South African Liberal Party, and a leading political voice of his time. Lost City of the Kalahari is Paton&#39;s hitherto unpublished account of the odd adventure. Recounted with dry, self-deprecating wit and supplemented by hand-drawn maps, provisions lists, photographs, 8mm film stills, and other fascinating memorabilia from the period, this entertaining travelogue brings to life the quirky cast of characters, rough discomforts of the journey, tedium of unvarying landscape, vast desert vistas, and encounters with wild Bushmen and other Kalahari people. And through it all, emerges Paton&#39;s own deep love for the austere landscape that &#34;one can never have too much of because it is like breathing.&#34;</p><p>Alan Paton, a native son of South Africa, was born in Pietermaritzburg, in the province of Natal, in 1903. Paton&#39;s initial career was spent teaching in schools for the sons of rich, white South Africans, But at thirty, he suffered a severe attack of enteric fever, and in the time he had to reflect upon his life, he decided that he did not want to spend his life teaching the sons of the rich. He got a job as principal of Diepkloof Reformatory, a huge prison school for delinquent black boys, on the edge of Johannesburg. He worked at Diepkloof for ten years, and at the end of it Paton felt so strongly that he needed a change, that he sold his life insurance policies to finance a prison-study trip that took him to Scandinavia, England, and the United States. It was during this time that he unexpectedly wrote his first published novel, &#34;Cry, the Beloved Country&#34;. It stands as the single most important novel in South African literature. Alan Paton died in 1988 in South Africa.</p><h2>The last of the Tasmanians</h2><p>Good condition book with like DJ. Boards are clean with minor bumping to corners and spine ends.

Most of us spend a lot of time divorcing parts and pieces of ourselves in order to care for someone else. For example, you like to go jogging but instead of jogging, you spend that time with your partner to show him or her that you really care. &#34;I love you so much that I would give up this thing that is valuable to me so I can be with you.&#34; This is one of the ways you divorce you to create an intimate relationship. How often does divorcing you really work in the long run? When you give up any part of yourself, you give up what was so attractive about you to that other person in the first place and pretty soon the other person doesn&#39;t want to be with you anymore. A divorceless relationship is one where you don&#39;t have to divorce any part of you in order to be in a relationship with someone else. It is a place where everyone and everything you are in a relationship with can become greater as a result of the relationship. Divorceless Relationship contains tools, exercises and processes you can use to: � Create divorceless relationships � Discover what you would like as a relationship � Discover what is true for you � Use energy to attract the person you&#39;re interested in � Know when it&#39;s time to leave a relationship � Renew and recreate your relationship with your partner � Bring sex back into your relationship � Turn your lover on</p><p></p><h2>The Deadly Sisterhood</h2><p>Here are the stories of the most remarkable women of Christendom, who are all joined by birth, marriage and friendship and who ruled for a time in place of their men-folk: Lucrezia Turnabuoni, Clarice Orsini, Beatrice d&#39;Este, Caterina Sforza, Isabella d&#39;Este, Giulia Farnese, Isabella d&#39;Aragona and Lucrezia Borgia.</p><p><p>In an epic drama of love, death, and betrayal, Leonie Frieda charts the rise and fall of the Italian Renaissance through the lives of the princesses who helped shape it.</p> <p>Mothers of popes and wives of princes, the women who feature in <em>The Deadly Sisterhood</em> were joined by birth, marriage, or friendship, and all ruled for a time in the place of their dead or absent menfolk. An intricate network of blood ties bound them together even as passion, treachery, and greed set sister against sister. These were women who were not afraid to wield the sword against their enemies in the murderous struggles that dominated the Italian Peninsula in the fifteenth century. Each experienced great riches, power, and the warm smile of fortune, but each also knew banishment, imprisonment, poverty, attempts on her life, and the loss of a husband or child.</p> <p>Leonie Frieda brilliantly reassesses the reputations of celebrated figures such as Isabella d'Este and Lucrezia Borgia, while exposing the influence of neglected characters such as Isabella d'Aragona and Clarice Orsini on the brutal dynastic conflicts of the fifteenth century.</p> <p>From sleeping with the enemy to leading troops into battle, <em>The Deadly Sisterhood</em> explodes the myth that Renaissance women were passive bystanders. Far from being confined to patronage and piety, these women proved that as rulers, politicians, warriors, and lovers they equalled&#x2014;if not overshadowed&#x2014;the men whose power they shared.</p>Swedish by birth, but educated in Britain, Leonie Frieda speaks five languages and is a member of the Institute of Linguists. Her long interest in Catherine de Medici resulted in a biography that was a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic and was translated into six languages.

Her aim is to provide recipes based on both models for the average cook--and she succeeds very well. Few special techniques are needed to prepare these entrees; most can be assembled with basic cooking skills and a bit of advance planning. The book's chapters on poultry, meats and fish each include a brief introduction, and these preambles are perhaps the best part of the volume, for here the author passes on cooking tips culled from years of experience. She also suggests easy-to-prepare side dishes. Although recipes call for fresh ingredients, Levy notes where frozen or canned substitutes can be used. The only possible quibble is that she relies on fresh herbs, and makes no suggestion of how to substitute dried if fresh are not available. Photos not seen by PW. Author tour.

We believe that an enormous effort is required to achieve success, and if we fail, it is because we did not work hard enough. </p><p> The Rainmaker, however, teaches us that the most successful people do not necessarily work harder. In fact, they are often more at ease than the people around them. The truth is that success comes to those who find a balance between effort and ease, striving and compromise. For those who know the Rainmaker's secrets, prosperity seems more like the result of good luck or being in the right place at the right time--the pieces just come together. </p><p> Using simple metaphors and exercises--and offering immediate applications--Chin-Ning Chu explains how you can discover the Rainmaker's power of doing less and achieving more. She teaches the arts of fine-tuning and focusing your actions, putting your mind at ease and seeing the fun in the game of life, and discovering the unlimited, miracle-producing power of giving in to and working with--rather than fighting against--your successful destiny.</p></p><p>Chin-Ning Chu is the bestselling American author in Asia.

She lives in Northern California.Do Less, Achieve More<p>When the Rainmaker first arrived in the village, the drought was severe and disastrous. If he were like you and me, he would get very busy very quickly: talking to the villagers about the history of rain Patterns and setting up a ceremony hall to pray for rain -- but he didn't busy himself at all.</p><p>The Chinese word for "busy" consists of two parts. One part symbolizes the human heart, the other part symbolizes death. The meaning that can be extrapolated is that when one is excessively busy, his heart is dead. Yet in our society today everyone praises the virtue of busyness. When people ask you, "Are you busy?" you are most likely to answer, "Yes, I am so very busy; I have no time to chat." You will never say, "No, I have nothing to do," even if it is true. We associate busyness with success; only not-so-successful people are not busy. In reality, we find there are plenty of people who are very busy but going nowhere. "Busy" is not always a virtue; it often means the heart is being neglected.</p><p>Our Rainmaker's objective is to make rain, not to put on a show. He does not need to feign being industrious to impress anyone. In order to bring about his desired result, he does very little -- he settles himself down in a tent and glides into meditation. By doing very little, by embracing ease, he brings a state of harmony unto himself, and from him it overflows into the whole village. By doing less, the Rainmaker achieves more.</p><p>One of the main principles taught in <i>hatha yoga,</i> the Indian system of physical postures, is to allow the body to relax into a given yoga stretch instead of pushing the body into the desired posture. When you are anxious to get into the full extension and you coerce your body into position, your body inevitably resists.</p><p>When you are open and relaxed, working without effort, not attempting to get anywhere, the body opens from inside naturally and allows you to ease into deep and complete stretching. Our attitudes to ward success and the obtaining of the symbols of achievement work much the same way.</p>The Dilemma Of Action And Anxiety<p>When you are pursuing any task with great anxiety, it takes a tremendous effort to realize a meager result. You are desiring and thinking so much; you are tired even before you start to work. Though your body has performed no task, your mind has been working hard at fighting and resisting your perceived circumstances.</p><p>Prior to moving a single muscle, the mind has traveled high and low, through glory and defeat. So much energy is expended within the mind before you have had the chance to engage it in the valid pursuit of your goals that the anxiety of wanting has driven you ever further from achieving what you want. You become as ineffective as a wound-up mechanical doll, spinning involuntarily. You want to be relaxed but don't know how to let go of the thousand details that should have been done yesterday. When you force yourself to slow down, you feel guilty.</p>The Rhythm Of Ease And Effort<p>We think that making an effort is the opposite of being at ease. The paradoxical truth is that effort and ease are not in opposition -- they complement each other. Like an Olympic runner, to win a competition you must put forth much effort. Yet in order to ensure maximum performance, you must strike a balance between the effort of striving and the ease of fluid action. The same holds true for figure skating. When skaters put forth too much energy, they overspin and fall. On the other hand, if they don't give their optimal mental and physical effort, they will fall short of their best performance.</p><p>The goal to seek in the expending of effort is to have it become effortless. As a ballerina dances on her toes, her beauty and grace show through because of the endless hours of practice she puts in. Luciano Pavarotti has trained himself to sing an entire opera with his voice totally relaxed. In order to have this relaxed voice, he had to train every part of his body to handle the exertion that allows his voice to be relaxed. You have to become strong in order to relax and surrender to life's challenges. Grace and relaxation are supported by great strength. This secret of success that guides the mastery of a world-class singer, runner, or dancer stems from the same principles that lead to a superior person in any endeavor.</p>The Harmony Of Compromise And Striving<p>Within the dualistic nature of achieving is the power of compromise and striving. Think of how a river embodies these two natures. It compromises with the geographical terrain, eroding and smoothing the way as it goes while relentlessly flowing forward, striving to achieve its ultimate purpose of uniting with the ocean. These two natures are always simultaneously in balance.</p><p>The river prioritizes its effort: Gushing on to the ocean is its first goal, and removing or getting around the rock is its first goal, and removing or getting around the rock is its second. While achieving its second objective, it never loses sight of its first objective. The river has no time to stop flowing and focus on destroying a single obstructing rock before pressing onward.</p><p>In this same manner, while you put forth your exertions in striving to accomplish, remain ever diligent with a watchful eye, seeking out the rhythm of ease on the way to your goal. This principle runs throughout every aspect of our lives. In our marital lives, the first objective is to strive for sustaining and creating a loving and harmonious environment for our family...</p></p><h2>Gospel in the Stars</h2><p>This historic book may have numerous typos, missing text or index. Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1882. Not illustrated. Excerpt: ... THE GOSPEL IN THE STARS. ILectute jFirst. THE STARRY WORLDS. Gen. 1:14: &#34;And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years.&#34; THE sublimest visible objects of human contemplation are the Starry Heavens. The beholder is awed at every thoughtful look upon them. And when viewed in the light of astronomical science the mind is overwhelmed and lost amid the vastness and magnificence of worlds and systems which roll and shine above, around and beneath us. The Sun. The most conspicuous, to us, of these wonderful orbs is the Sun. Seemingly, it is not as large as the wheel of a wagon, but when we learn that we see it only at the distance of more than ninety-one millions of miles, and consider how the apparent size of objects diminishes in proportion to their remoteness, we justly conclude that it must be of enormous magnitude to be&#39;so conspicuous across a gulf so vast. Our earth is a large body; it takes long and toilsome journeying for a man to make his way around it. But the Sun fills more than a million times the cubic space filled by the earth. A railway-train running thirty miles an hour, and &#34; never stopping, could not go around it in less than eleven years, nor run the distance from the earth to the Sun in less than three hundred and sixty years. If we were to take a string long enough to reach the moon, and draw a circle with it at its utmost stretch, the Sun would still be six times larger than that circle. Belonging to the system of which it is the centre there are eight primary planets, some of them more than a thousand times larger than our earth, besides eighty-five asteroids, twentyone satellites or moons, and several hundred comets. But t...</p><p>Did God arrange the stars in the sky to spell out his ultimate plans for the human race? Such is the conclusion of this curious book, first published in 1882 as an attempt to reconcile Christianity with the public fascination with astrology... a fascination that endures today. <p> In this profusely illustrated volume, discover the connections between the signs of the Zodiac and Christian symbolism--Leo the lion represents Jesus, for instance; the Gemini twins signify both the relationship of Adam and Eve as well as God's relationship with his church. Building upon this language of the stars, the author demonstrates the truth of God's "one plan and purpose of Redemption for fallen man."</p>American Lutheran pastor JOSEPH AUGUST SEISS (1823-1904) was born in Maryland and served congregations in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.

His father is back now, though C.J. is not as quick to forgive as the other members of his family. He still feels the weight of responsibility that fell on his shoulders when Daddy was gone, and he's not prepared to give that up. But C.J.'s anger is making him a stranger in his own home, and instead of life seeming better now that Daddy has returned, it feels worse.</p><p>Through powerful poems, Hope Anita Smith chronicles the nuanced emotions of a family that is slowly learning to heal and put the pieces back together.</p><p><i>Keeping the Night Watch</i> is a 2009 Coretta Scott King Author Honor Book and a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p><b>Hope Anita Smith</b> is the author of <i>The Way a Door Closes, </i>the prequel to <i>Keeping the Night Watch</i>.

Grade 5&#x2013;8&#x2014;This book picks up where <i>The Way a Door Closes</i> (Holt, 2003) left off. Now that C.J.'s father, who had left the family, has returned, the teen notes that dinners are like "a roomful of strangers" and that he feels weighed down by "brick heavy" questions. Wise beyond his years, eldest son C.J. felt it was his role to "keep the night watch" during his father's absence. Now, he feels displaced in his own home and seethes with anger and resentment. Gradually, everyone starts to move on: C.J. experiences the awkward elation of first love, tries his hand at shaving, and argues and makes up with his best friend. His little sister sends love notes to each family member, and, at book's end, C.J. and his family come together: "We dance on our tears." As in the previous book, Smith masterfully brings her characters to life from the inside out in straightforward free verse. Lewis uses his brilliantly composed, watercolor-and-ink paintings to underscore the strong emotions of the text. This hopeful book celebrates the power of families to heal and overcome hard times. It will speak to the hearts of many readers.&#x2014;<i>Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The effect might not be easy to see. There will be a small ripple where the stone breaks the surface and then a splash, muffled by the rush of the surrounding river. That&#x2019;s all.</p><p>Throw a stone into a lake. The effect will be not only visible but also far more lasting. The stone will disrupt the still waters. A circle will form where the stone hit the water, and in a flash that circle will multiply into another, then another. Before long the ripples caused by one plop will expand until they can be felt everywhere along the mirrored surface of the water. Only when the circles reach the shore will they stop and die out.</p><p>If a stone hits a river, the river will treat it as yet another commotion in its already tumultuous course. Nothing unusual. Nothing unmanageable.</p><p>If a stone hits a lake, however, the lake will never be the same again.</p><p>For forty years Ella Rubinstein&#x2019;s life had consisted of still waters&#x2014;a predictable sequence of habits, needs, and preferences. Though it was monotonous and ordinary in many ways, she had not found it tiresome. During the last twenty years, every wish she had, every person she befriended, and every decision she made was filtered through her marriage. Her husband, David, was a successful dentist who worked hard and made a lot of money. She had always known that they did not connect on any deep level, but connecting emotionally need not be a priority on a married couple&#x2019;s list, she thought, especially for a man and a woman who had been married for so long. There were more important things than passion and love in a marriage, such as understanding, affection, compassion, and that most godlike act a person could perform, forgiveness. Love was secondary to any of these. Unless, that is, one lived in novels or romantic movies, where the protagonists were always larger than life and their love nothing short of legend.</p><p>Ella&#x2019;s children topped her list of priorities. They had a beautiful daughter in college, Jeannette, and teenage twins, Orly and Avi. Also, they had a twelve-year-old golden retriever, Spirit, who had been Ella&#x2019;s walking buddy in the mornings and her cheeriest companion ever since he&#x2019;d been a puppy. Now he was old, overweight, completely deaf, and almost blind; Spirit&#x2019;s time was coming, but Ella preferred to think he would go on forever. Then again, that was how she was. She never confronted the death of anything, be it a habit, a phase, or a marriage, even when the end stood right in front of her, plain and inevitable.</p><p>The Rubinsteins lived in Northampton, Massachusetts, in a large Victorian house that needed some renovation but still was splendid, with five bedrooms, three baths, shiny hardwood floors, a three-car garage, French doors, and, best of all, an outdoor Jacuzzi. They had life insurance, car insurance, retirement plans, college savings plans, joint bank accounts, and, in addition to the house they lived in, two prestigious apartments: one in Boston, the other in Rhode Island. She and David had worked hard for all this. A big, busy house with children, elegant furniture, and the wafting scent of homemade pies might seem a clich� to some people, but to them it was the picture of an ideal life. They had built their marriage around this shared vision and had attained most, if not all, of their dreams.</p><p>On their last Valentine&#x2019;s Day, her husband had given her a heart-shaped diamond pendant and a card that read,</p><p></p><p>To my dear Ella,</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>A woman with a quiet manner, a generous heart, and the patience of a saint. Thank you for accepting me as I am. Thank you for being my wife.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Yours,</p><p>David</p><p></p><p></p><p>Ella had never confessed this to David, but reading his card had felt like reading an obituary. This is what they will write about me when I <i>die,</i> she had thought. And if they were sincere, they might also add this:</p><p><i>Building her whole life around her husband and children, Ella lacked any survival techniques to help her cope with life&#x2019;s hardships on her own. She was not the type to throw caution to the wind. Even changing her daily coffee brand was a major effort.</i></p><p>All of which is why no one, including Ella, could explain what was going on when she filed for divorce in the fall of 2008 after twenty years of marriage.</p><p>But there was a reason: love.</p><p>They did not live in the same city. Not even on the same continent. The two of them were not only miles apart but also as different as day and night. Their lifestyles were so dissimilar that it seemed impossible for them to bear each other&#x2019;s presence, never mind fall in love. But it happened. And it happened fast, so fast in fact that Ella had no time to realize what was happening and to be on guard, if one could ever be on guard against love.</p><p>Love came to Ella as suddenly and brusquely as if a stone had been hurled from out of nowhere into the tranquil pond of her life.</p><p><b>Ella</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>NORTHAMPTON, MAY 17, 2008</b></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>B</b>irds were singing outside her kitchen window on that balmy day in spring. Afterward Ella replayed the scene in her mind so many times that, rather than a fragment from the past, it felt like an ongoing moment still happening somewhere out there in the universe.</p><p>There they were, sitting around the table, having a late family lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Her husband was filling his plate with fried chicken legs, his favorite food. Avi was playing his knife and fork like drumsticks while his twin, Orly, was trying to calculate how many bites of which food she could eat so as not to ruin her diet of 650 calories a day. Jeannette, who was a freshman at Mount Holyoke College nearby, seemed lost in her thoughts as she spread cream cheese on another slice of bread. Also at the table sat Aunt Esther, who had stopped by to drop off one of her famous marble cakes and then stayed on for lunch. Ella had a lot of work to do afterward, but she was not ready to leave the table just yet. Lately they didn&#x2019;t have too many shared family meals, and she saw this as a golden chance for everyone to reconnect.</p><p>&#x201c;Esther, did Ella give you the good news?&#x201d; David asked suddenly. &#x201c;She found a great job.&#x201d;</p><p>Though Ella had graduated with a degree in English literature and loved fiction, she hadn&#x2019;t done much in the field after college, other than editing small pieces for women&#x2019;s magazines, attending a few book clubs, and occasionally writing book reviews for some local papers. That was all. There was a time when she&#x2019;d aspired to become a prominent book critic, but then she simply accepted the fact that life had carried her elsewhere, turning her into an industrious housewife with three kids and endless domestic responsibilities.</p><p>Not that she complained. Being the mother, the wife, the dog walker, and the housekeeper kept her busy enough. She didn&#x2019;t have to be a breadwinner on top of all these. Though none of her feminist friends from Smith College approved of her choice, she was satisfied to be a stay-at-home mom and grateful that she and her husband could afford it. Besides, she had never abandoned her passion for books and still considered herself a voracious reader.</p><p>A few years ago, things had begun to change. The children were growing up, and they made it clear that they didn&#x2019;t need her as much as they once had. Realizing that she had too much time to spare and no one to spend it with, Ella had considered how it might be to find a job. David had encouraged her, but though they kept talking and talking about it, she rarely pursued the opportunities that came her way, and when she did, potential employers were always looking for someone younger or more experienced. Afraid of being rejected over and over, she had simply let the subject drop.</p><p>Nevertheless, in May 2008 whatever obstacle had impeded her from finding a job all these years unexpectedly vanished. Two weeks shy of her fortieth birthday, she found herself working for a literary agency based in Boston. It was her husband who found her the job through one of his clients&#x2014;or perhaps through one of his mistresses.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s no big deal,&#x201d; Ella rushed to explain now. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only a part-time reader for a literary agent.&#x201d;</p><p>But David seemed determined not to let her think too little of her new job. &#x201c;Come on, tell them it&#x2019;s a well-known agency,&#x201d; he urged, nudging her, and when she refused to comply, he heartily agreed with himself. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a prestigious place, Esther. You should see the other assistants! Girls and boys fresh out of the best colleges. Ella is the only one going back to work after being a housewife for years. Now, isn&#x2019;t she something?&#x201d;</p><p>Ella wondered if, deep inside, her husband felt guilty about keeping her away from a career, or else about cheating on her&#x2014;these being the only two explanations she could think of as to why he was now going overboard in his enthusiasm.</p><p>Still smiling, David concluded, &#x201c;This is what I call chutzpah. We&#x2019;re all proud of her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She is a prize. Always was,&#x201d; said Aunt Esther in a voice so sentimental that it sounded as if Ella had left the table and was gone for good.</p><p>They all gazed at her lovingly. Even Avi didn&#x2019;t make a cynical remark, and Orly for once seemed to care about something other than her looks. Ella forced herself to appreciate this moment of kindness, but she felt an overwhelming exhaustion that she had never experienced before. She secretly prayed for someone to change the subject.</p><p>Jeannette, her older daughter, must have heard the prayer, for she suddenly chimed in, &#x201c;I have some good news, too.&#x201d;</p><p>All heads turned toward her, faces beaming with expectation.</p><p>&#x201c;Scott and I have decided to get married,&#x201d; Jeannette announced. &#x201c;Oh, I know what you guys are going to say! That we haven&#x2019;t finished college yet and all that, but you&#x2019;ve got to understand, we both feel...</p></p><h2>Cabochon Cutting (A Gemcutters Handbook)</h2><p>Cabochons are gemstones with domed tops that are cut to various shapes, such as ovals, circles, rectangles and hearts.

Married at nineteen to John Ruskin, the leading art critic of the time, she found herself trapped in a loveless, unconsummated union after Ruskin rejected her on their wedding night. On a trip to Scotland she met John Everett Millais, Ruskin's prot�g�, and fell passionately in love with him. In a daring act, Effie left Ruskin, had their marriage annulled and entered into a long, happy marriage with Millais. Suzanne Fagence Cooper has gained exclusive access to Effie's previously unseen letters and diaries to tell the complete story of this scandalous love triangle. In Cooper's hands, this passionate love story also becomes an important new look at the work of both Ruskin and Millais with Effie emerging as a key figure in their artistic development. <i>Effie </i>is a heartbreakingly beautiful book about three lives passionately entwined with some of the greatest paintings of the pre-Raphaelite period.</p></p><p>SUZANNE FAGENCE COOPER is a research fellow and curator at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum. She has also worked as a consultant for the BBC. Suzanne lives in London and York.Effie<br>Chapter OneSpring: 1854THE MORNING of Tuesday, 25 April 1854 was achingly cold. Effie said goodbye to her husband, John Ruskin, for the last time on the platform at King's Cross Station. Then he helped her into the train. Taking a seat beside her sister, Sophy, she avoided his eye, preoccupied with arranging the cage of her crinoline in the cramped compartment. Effie hoped never to see him again. For a man who had made his name as a visionary critic of modern art, John Ruskin could be remarkably blinkered. His attention was focused on pictures, not people. He was anxious to get back to his parents' house and his books, and noticed nothing unusual in Effie's strained appearance. It had become her habit.The temperature had dropped the previous night. As Effie's train headed north, John drove south to the suburb of Denmark Hill, where his father was fretting about frost damage to his pear trees.Leaving London behind, Effie removed her gloves and slipped off her wedding ring. She tucked it inside an envelope addressed to her mother-in-law, together with her house keys and account book. Ten-year-old Sophy was bewildered. She had witnessed her sister's misery during the past months. But Effie had not dared tell her how this journey would end. As far as Sophy knew, Effie was going home to Scotland for a holiday, while John and his parents travelled to Switzerland. Effie did not have much time to explain. Just after ten o'clock the train was due to stop for a few minutes at Hitchin, where her father and mother were waiting. Effie could see them on the platform as they drew into the station. She gave her sister a hurried kiss, then Sophy jumped down to join their father. Effie's mother took her place in the carriage beside Effie. Her father reached up to receive the envelope containing her wedding ring. Effie asked him to post it, together with a few notes addressed to her closest friends. A handful of them knew her plans. She hoped they would defend her actions in her absence. Effie knew that London society would bescandalised by her decision to leave John Ruskin. His writings had made him something of a celebrity. Ever since the summer of 1843, when he had published his tribute to Turner in <i>Modern Painters</i>, he had been the most admired art critic of his generation. When Charlotte Bront� had read his words she had exclaimed, 'I feel now as if I had been walking blindfold-this book seems to give me eyes.' Elizabeth Barrett Browning agreed. She thought John Ruskin was 'no ordinary man'. He was inspirational, he was brilliant, he was invited to all the best parties, and he had a handsome private income. So why was Effie running away?Effie and her mother had a long journey before them, changing at Edinburgh for Perth. They did not expect to be on the road home to Bowerswell until well after midnight. It gave them ample time to mull over the six years of Effie's marriage. Mrs Gray could see the expression of pain above Effie's eyebrows, a twitch that marred her daughter's fine features. She had known from Effie's increasingly disjointed letters that her relationship with the Ruskins was deteriorating. But it was not until early March that the Grays had discovered the secret of Effie's distress. John had refused to consummate their marriage. Writing on 6 March 1854, Effie had entreated her parents to help her escape from this unnatural relationship. In this letter she claimed that John believed she was unfit to be a mother as 'if I was not very <i>wicked</i> I was at least insane'. No wonder she was often ill. Effie was only twenty-five, but living a lie had left her exhausted.1Shocked but uncertain how to proceed, Mr and Mrs Gray had dithered for several weeks before deciding to come to London. Her father was unsure whether to confront John directly or seek legal advice about Effie's position: in law, an unconsummated marriage was no marriage at all. The Grays eventually arrived by steamer from Dundee on Good Friday, 14 April. Effie had not told the Ruskins of her parents' arrival, for fear that they would draw the two families into a pointless and poisonous argument. She had already warned her father that old Mr Ruskin would not hesitate to resort to underhand tactics if he thought his family name would be dishonoured. Worse still, if John got wind of her complaints, he might force her to consummate the marriage. Then she would have no hope of escape. She could not divorce him.The 1850s were a time of upheaval in the laws governing marriage. Effie's story was part of a wider shift in women's roles and expectations. Women aswell as men were benefiting from an information revolution; the arrival of the electric telegraph, the popular press and a daily postal service meant that this generation had an unprecedented view of the world. The old certainties were wearing thin as in London, Leeds and Glasgow women and men rubbed shoulders with people of all classes and many nations. The pace of life was quickening. Effie and her contemporaries felt the buzz of modernity.The Queen herself drew attention to the novelties and paradoxes of the Victorian age. She showed up the shortcomings of gender stereotyping. Victoria was a wife and mother, as well as Sovereign. Her authority over her nation and her growing empire could have a beneficial effect for other women. They might look beyond the home and the family and see the potential for a wider sphere of influence. As an ambitious wife, Effie had hoped to use her social skills to promote her husband's career, but her talents were stifled by the conventions of an older generation, and she had found herself trapped in a loveless marriage.In England before 1857, a divorce could only be granted by a special Act of Parliament. It was a costly and time-consuming business. In an open letter to the Queen, published in 1855, the poet Caroline Norton drew attention to the impossible position of women like herself, who wanted to end an abusive marriage. Her account is sobering: an English wife had no property of her own, not even her clothes or jewellery. She could not make a will. If she left her husband, he could bring her home by force. She could sue him for cruelty, but only if he 'endangered life and limb'. If she went back to him, she could not complain if he beat her again, as she had 'condoned' his actions. It was the same with adultery. If she forgave her philandering husband once, she had no legal redress. As a husband was not bound to pay maintenance, a wife often could not afford to leave the marital home, however badly she was treated. According to Mrs Norton, during Victoria's reign only four women had been granted a divorce in order to marry again. In two of those cases the husband had been guilty of incest.How did the law apply in Effie's case? If John compelled her to fulfil her conjugal duties, there was nothing she could do. Husbands might rape their wives with impunity. As she had been married in Scotland, she was a little better protected in some ways than her English friends. A Scottish wife could defend herself against accusations of infidelity, could demand financial support, and her clothes and 'paraphernalia' belonged to her. However, she couldstill only sue for a divorce on the grounds of her husband's infidelity or desertion, and John was guilty of neither. Effie had two options. She could simply leave John, in the hope that he would let her return to her parents' house, or she could seek an annulment and face the indignities of a court case, a messy and intrusive business. If she chose this second course, Effie would need to be examined by doctors to prove that, after sharing John's bed for six years, she was still a virgin. And how would she defend herself against her husband's accusations that she was mentally unstable? John was known to make notes of her mood swings, and some of her recent letters had verged on the hysterical. Effie discussed these difficulties with her parents over the Easter weekend, and they came to the conclusion that they would have to take John Ruskin to court and sue for an annulment. On Monday afternoon she wrote to a friend: 'Papa is quite hopeful about my case, having found a similar one decided last year. The Ruskins have not a suspicion.' She was keenly aware of the hard road ahead, ending the letter: 'Dear friend if I never see you again, God bless and prosper all your undertakings.'2Effie could have just walked away from the marriage. It seems that her husband hoped she would. In her final letter to her mother-in-law, she revealed how John had threatened to break her spirit and force her to return to her parents. He claimed she bored him. However, it was a shock when Effie refused to go quietly.Effie could not admit to John's mother the real reason she was pushing for an annulment. She could hardly admit it even to herself. But her friends and family were urging her to expose the sham of this 'pretended marriage' in the hope that she would marry again. They already had someone in mind; her affection for the young artist John Everett Millais was understood by those who knew her best.Everett Millais was not the first to have fallen in love with the young Mrs Ruskin. Elegant, entertaining and light on her feet, she was much in demand at dinners and dances. In the early days of their marriage Effie had many admirers, and John positively encouraged her social success. From his point of view, if she was invited out for supper or to the theatre, he had more space to write. He had even reassured her parents when, in 1852, some gossip had reached their ears about her friendship with Clare Ford, 'a sort of man about Town'. John had praised her shrewdness in detecting the slightest impropriety. He even suggested that she was more likely to be labelled a prude than aflirt. He believed that, under Effie's influence, Ford had become more responsible; she had already persuaded him to give up the high life and move to a quiet job in the country instead.Effie's ability to attract young men did not always have such positive results. On a visit she made to Verona two Austrian officers fought a duel over who should dance with her. One was left nursing a severe sabre wound. Effie treated it as a joke, saying it was absurd how 'these young men think as little of Duelling as they do of smoking a cigar'. However, as her relationship with her husband began to unravel, her desire to walk the tightrope between friendship and flirtation became increasingly risky.At the critical moment in their marriage, John decided to champion a group of rebellious young artists who called themselves the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He approved of their attempts to paint with innocent eyes, going to nature 'in all singleness of heart', as he had suggested in <i>Modern Painters</i>, 'selecting nothing, rejecting nothing and scorning nothing'. It seemed that this band of artistic brothers had responded to his rallying call. John asked the most precociously talented of the Brotherhood, John Everett Millais, to join them on holiday. As both Ruskin and the handsome young artist were christened John, Effie took to calling Millais by his middle name, Everett. My account of their story will follow this family tradition.In July 1853 Everett and the Ruskins rented a cottage near Glenfinlas in Perthshire. John wanted Everett to paint him there, choosing a 'lovely piece of worn rock, with foaming water, and weeds, and moss, and a noble overhanging bank of dark crag' as a backdrop. It was to be the archetypal Pre-Raphaelite picture, a detailed study of natural forms combined with a portrait of the art movement's most vocal supporter. But Everett also made numerous sketches of Effie. He painted her sitting beside a waterfall, or quietly sewing, with foxgloves tucked into her hair. He also helped Effie with her own drawings, took long walks with her in the evenings and sheltered with her under a shawl, waiting for the rain to stop. She read Dante to him and even cut his hair.That summer Everett was well placed to see the cracks in the Ruskins' marriage: the cottage they all shared was tiny. John slept on the sofa, while Effie and Everett each had their own little closet, five feet by seven, to sleep and dress in. Everett was over six feet tall, and in a bedroom 'not much larger than a snuffbox' he claimed he could open the window, shut the door andshave, all without getting out of bed. Despite the discomfort, he chose to stay close to Effie rather than sleep at the inn with other members of their party. As he admitted to a friend, 'these chilling mountains make one love little soft, warm, breathing bodies'.After returning to London in the autumn, Everett became increasingly troubled by what he had seen that summer. He began to fear that John Ruskin was 'a plotting and scheming fellow' who had deliberately left him alone with Effie to force her into a compromising position. Before long, Effie was also worrying that her husband was deliberately trying to get her into a 'scrape'. By Christmas, Everett had decided that he should warn Effie's mother about 'the <i>wretchedness</i> of her position'. Writing to her on 19 December 1853, he complained of John's selfishness and the way he constantly pointed out his wife's shortcomings. In his haste to catch the post that night Everett let something slip: he knew why Effie was so unhappy. She had already told him the secret of her failed marriage.&nbsp;<br>So Effie became the heroine of a great Victorian love story. Her life reads like a novel, full of colour, sensation, despair and romance. Her first husband was a damaged genius, her second a handsome rebel. We can chart her journey in every detail, thanks to a vast collection of correspondence treasured by her family since her death. Fifteen bulging parcels of letters, tied up in brown paper and string, were lent to the Tate Archive in 2009. Inside the wrappings lay the raw material for this book. It was a biographer's dream. In the coming chapters, every landscape, every t�te-�-t�te, every ball gown, is drawn from these astonishing original sources. There has been no need to make anything up, or to embroider the facts. It was all there, down to the last ribbon, waiting to be discovered in the archives.We hear Effie's voice directly. She writes several times a week to her parents, telling them about her highs and lows. Through the letters we learn about her travels, the sights and smells of her home, her dance partners, her miserable marriage. And later she describes her hopes for the future with Everett and the daily struggles of motherhood. We also hear the other side of the conversation. The tales told by her father guide us through Effie's world, as he keeps her up to date with family news. Sometimes George Gray sounds like Mr Bennet in <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, escaping to his study to avoid the fallout from his daughters' love affairs. Mrs Gray's letters are harder todecipher. Her handwriting is rapid and spidery. Effie's mother held on to an old habit from before the days of the penny post: to save paper she crossed her letters, writing first in one direction, then when she had filled up the sheet, turning the paper through ninety degrees and adding more lines. Her notes become networks of overlapping words. Trying to read through one layer to reach the other can be almost impossible. It makes us remember that they were written for Effie's eyes and not for ours. But almost miraculously, when we most need to hear her version of events, Mrs Gray's handwriting suddenly becomes legible. From her accounts, we can piece together for the first time the tragic story of Sophy, Effie's sister, and discover why this young girl...</p><h2>Secret Symbolism in Occult Art</h2><p>Looks at amulets, tarot cards, monoliths, hill carvings, mazes, clocks, frescoes, and gargoyles, and discusses the portrayal of demons and magic in paintings, engravings, sculpture, and stained glass</p><p></p><h2>When Duty Calls (Legion of the Damned)</h2><p>As the war with the Ramanthian continues, Captain Antonio Santana and his force of biobods and cyborgs find themselves surrounded by enemy forces, faced with annihilation at every turn. On the home front, diplomat Christine Vanderveen finds herself torn between her love for Santana and her new loyalty towards the charismatic, recently elected president of the Clone Republic. As Christine fights her own divided heart, light years away, Santana is in a battle for his life. And this battle may be his last.</p><p>William C.

Dietz has been variously employed as a surgical technician, college instructor, news writer and television producer, and currently serves as Director of Public Relations and Marketing for an international telephone company.Duty summons two principals in the long-running Legion of the Damned series in opposite directions. Captain Antonio Santana must try to lead his Legion company out from alien encirclement and encounters a few unusual problems, such as commanding a mixed unit of purely biological and cyborg soldiers. Meanwhile, his lover, diplomat Christine Vanderveen, knows that the situation of the Clone Republic is rapidly deteriorating. The charismatic new president, who&#x2019;s getting powerfully attractive to Christine, may, however, save the day. The action is as brisk as ever in a Legion yarn.

The finest complete musical transcript of Brahms, published by Breitkopf &amp; H�rtel (for whom Brahms worked as editor), is reproduced here &#x2014; the authoritative texts with new translations of the lyrics.<br>This volume (Series II of the complete Dover Brahms songs, published in four volumes) contains Stanley Appelbaum's new literal prose translations of 58 songs first published between 1868 and 1964. Among these are the famous "Lullaby" ("Wiegenlied") and "Unbewegte laue Luft," called by <i>Grove's Dictionary</i> "one of Brahms's finest, full of richly glowing color." Brahms found inspiration mainly in the German poets (with an occasional translation of the Persian Hafiz or the French poet-king Thibault IV) but his rhythms and melodies most often reflect his own complex personality rather than the conventional German folk-song style advocated by his fellow "nationalistic" composers.<br>In addition to the song texts, a translation of the original editor's commentary has been included, plus new listings of titles, opening lines, and poets.

"An enlightening and often dramatic study . . . as stimulating as it is informative."--<em>New York Times</em></p><p><b>Jaroslav Pelikan</b> is Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University. He is the author of more than thirty books, including <i>The Christian Tradition</i>, widely acknowledged as the foremost history of its kind, and, more recently, <i>Mary Through the Centuries</i>, published by Yale University Press."An enlightening and often dramatic story. . . . As a succinct account of the image of Christ before faith began to falter, in the indubitably Christian centuries, it is as stimulating as it is informative."&#x2015;John Gross, <i>New York Times</i><br>"Mr Pelikan, who is the Sterling Professor of History at Yale University, writes for a broad readership. What he offers us in <i>Jesus Through the Centuries</i> is a rich and expansive description of Jesus' impact on 'the general history of culture. . . . <i>Jesus Through the Centuries</i> seems to me unique among current publications in bridging scholarly and popular discourse on the prophet from Nazareth over the past 2,000 years. Believers and skeptics alike will find it a sweeping visual and conceptual panorama. Mr. Pelikan is particularly adept at discerning the political implications in various Jesus images."&#x2015;John Koenig, front page, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"Pelikan here draws on his commanding grasp of Christian history not to try his own hand at one more 'life' of Jesus, but to lay before us the principal images that have appeared, sometimes recurrently, from the 1st century to the 20th. Starting with 'The Rabbi' and moving with precision and balance through 18 well-crafted chapters, he uses stained glass and statuary, hymns and doggerel, creeds and exposes, to carry the reader finally to 'The Man Who Belongs to the World.' The final chapter demonstrates conclusively that if imaging Jesus ever was the monopoly of the 'Christian West,' it surely is no longer."&#x2015;Harvey Cox, front page, <i>Washington Post Book World</i><br>"Writing for the general reader, eminent church historian Pelikan proposes that, while the figure of Jesus provides the chief continuity in the history of Christianity, each age has depicted him in accordance with its own character."&#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i><br>"In a fascinating survey, he identifies a diverse and even contradictory array of devotional, artistic, political, and literary images of Jesus. . . . historians, skeptical and devout, will find numerous insights into the cultural development of the Christian West."&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br>"Yale historian Pelikan ably explores the universe of power and influence embedded in that revered five-letter name, as he surveys the role of the carpenter from Galilee in 'the general history of culture.' . . . A lively writer, Pelikan salts his study with delightful ironies and oddities, such as the crucial role played by two American presidents&#x2015;Jefferson and Lincoln, both believers in separation of church and state&#x2015;in redefining modern attitudes towards Jesus.&nbsp; He also offers some tantalizing speculations:&nbsp; would Auschwitz have befallen the Jews if Christendom had acknowledged Jesus as Rabbi Jeshua bar-Joseph as well as Son of God?&nbsp; The book as a whole suggests a larger question:&nbsp; what might our planet be like today if Jesus had never lived?&nbsp; On the basis of this stimulating, scholarly, but never tedious book, the question is too large to answer; Jesus's influence has been so pervasive that we cannot imagine the world without him."&#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br>"A fascinating study, by a Yale professor and theologian, of the varying reinterpretations of Christ from epoch to epoch."&#x2015;<i>National Review</i><br>"As a historian, Pelikan documents the image of Jesus in culture; as a Christian, he is compelled by the example of the Son of God.&nbsp;The book beats with a big heart. Arranged chronologically, the material in the book covers the astonishingly broad range of cultural functions played by Jesus since his birth in a village called Bethlehem on the western edge of the Judean wilderness. . . . The ultimate effect of Pelikan's gracious little masterpiece on this situation, which is becoming increasingly contentious, should, I think, give new meaning to the old image of Jesus as the Prince of Peace."&#x2014;Thomas D'Evelyn, <i>Christian Science Monitor</i><br>"We have here, besides feast for any reader, believer or not, a splendid educational tool, a welcome epilogue to H. Richard Niebuhr's <i>Christ and Culture</i> on a broader canvas."&#x2015;<i>Commonweal</i><br>"A work of scholarly virtuosity. . . .

For anyone interested in literature, the history of Western civilization, or theology, this book provides a wonderful resume. . . . Not many books combine so much sophistication and culture with personal faith and piety."&#x2014;H. Boone Porter, <i>The Living Church</i><br>"<i>Jesus Through the Centuries</i> is designed to take the nonspecialist, even nonreligious, reader on a pilgrimage through the Christian centuries in quest of the symbolic Jesus:&nbsp;the figure of Christ as framed successively by the sensibilities of generations past. . . . The range, insight and dramatic interest of Pelikan's survey make it truly an intellectual delight to read. . . . An admirable and impressive achievement."&#x2014;Daniel L. Pals,<i> Christian Century</i><br>"Pelikan sets forth intricate theological formulations so clearly that the general reader can follow them readily and can see how they evolved and compelled belief. . . . Beautifully written, intellectually stimulating, and a great pleasure to read."&#x2015;Stephanie Martin, <i>Wilson Library Bulletin</i><br>"Though it is based on a prodigious learning, it is a learning that is here deployed so gracefully and unobtrusively that this book will be found compellingly attractive by any cultivated reader who wants not so much a life of Jesus or a history of theological reflections on Jesus as an account of the various roles that have been played by Jesus of Nazareth 'in the general history of culture. . . . A book of uncommon brilliance . . . that wonderfully illumines every major moment in the history of Western culture and that reveals how indelibly this culture is marked by the Man Christ Jesus."&#x2015;Nathan A. Scott, Jr., <i>Commonweal</i><br>"Pelikan is one of those superb scholars who roams easily through a wide network of scholarly material, and in this volume he moves from century to century, indicating the influence of Jesus in the political, social, and economic histories of the western world. . . . A quite provocative book."&#x2014;Kenan B. Osborne,&nbsp;<i>Commonweal</i><br>Winner of the 1986 Logos Bookstores Award given by the Association of Logos Bookstores<br>"Jaroslav Pelikan has one of the most seminal minds in this generation.&nbsp; Nowhere is this more evident than in his most recent volume, <i>Jesus Through the Centuries</i>. It is not a doctrinal study nor a volume on the life of Christ but, rather, an analysis of some eighteen images of Jesus as he has been perceived through the centuries, images running from the Rabbi to the man who belongs to the world.&nbsp; Pelikan shows the enormous influence of Jesus on human culture, illustrating this through history, literature, philosophy, and art.&nbsp; It is a book that could only have been written by a mature scholar, but it can be read with profit and joy by anyone interested in the place of Jesus in the formation and development of culture from the first century until today.&nbsp; It is highly recommended."&#x2014;James I McCord, Chancellor, Center of Theological Inquiry, Princeton<br>"Like a master jeweler working with hard but valuable material, Jaroslav Pelikan has given distinctive shape to a great subject.&nbsp; He has chiseled eighteen surfaces, each with a different image of Jesus Christ affecting human culture.&nbsp; The result is an often glittering intellectual history that illuminates important chapters of human sensibility with flashes of light and color from Eastern as well as Western Christianity. <i>Jesus Through the Centuries</i> invites us to go beyond narrow scholarship in our study of that historical record and to reexamine what we are in the light of what Jesus was."&#x2015;James H. Billington, author of <i>Icon and the Axe</i> and <i>Fire in the Minds of Men</i><br>"With learned insight and readable style, Pelikan traces the cultural incarnations of Jesus through nineteen centuries. . . .He concludes that Jesus now belongs to the whole of humanity, far beyond the reach of the organized Church and ecclesial theology.&nbsp; And I agree."&#x2015;Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, C.S.C., President, University of Notre Dame<br>"<i>Jesus Through the Centuries</i> reflects the deep faith and spirituality of the noted historian and theologian Jaroslav Pelikan expressed with Apostolic simplicity and clarity.&nbsp; It expresses sound scriptural doctrine and profound cultural history of the last 2,000 years which can also serve as a blueprint for examining the images of Jesus through the study of politics, society, and economic events in history.&nbsp; Through its contents, the book evinces a profound understanding between tradition and innovation through each particular age marked by intellectual vigor, theological substance, humanity and warmth.&nbsp; Even more, Professor Pelikan emits an historical faith that is unabashedly Christocentric, straightforward and poetic, which will make the book appeal to a wide audience because of its rich humanism, and its informed use of references to writers and philosophers from St.&nbsp; Gregory of Nyssa to Albert Schweitzer.&nbsp; His book should be read by not only historians and theologians, but by all Christians who wish to seek ways of coming closer to one another through an understanding of Christ down through the ages."&#x2014;His Eminence Archbishop Iakovos, Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of North and South America<br></p><h2>Art Nouveau Patterns &amp; Designs</h2><p>Crescent Books, New York, 1988.

Hughes focuses on four postwar projects whose vastness and complexity inspired new technology, new organizations, and new management styles.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first use of computers to run systems was developed for the SAGE air defense project.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Atlas missile project was so complicated it required the development of systems engineering in order to complete it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Boston Central Artery/Tunnel Project tested systems engineering in the complex crucible of a large scale civilian roadway.&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally, the origins of the Internet fostered the collegial management style that later would take over Silicon Valley and define the modern computer industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;With keen insight, Hughes tells these fascinating stories while providing a riveting history of modern technology and the management systems that made it possible.</p><p>Building the pyramids was child's play compared with designing the Internet and other highly complex 20th-century projects. So many individuals and organizations had to come together to successfully build these more recent monumental structures that new ways of managing complex undertakings had to be invented on the spot. Eminent technology historian Thomas P. Hughes explores the development of systems engineering in <i>Rescuing Prometheus</i>, which focuses on four projects that are bewildering in their enormity, yet were completed successfully.<p> The SAGE air-defense project transformed computers from mathematical labor savers into decision-makers by proxy, and spawned the first elements of "postmodern management." Then, the Atlas missile program brought together the disparate elements of the military-industrial-university complex and demanded new, less hierarchical control over individual subprograms. This new way of thinking brought engineers such as Dean Wooldridge and Simon Ramo to prominence.</p><p> Hughes follows these developments in systems engineering closely as they were applied to ARPANET and Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel Project. Along the way those projects encountered both the simplifying synergy and maddening political slowdowns involved with not just a handful of problems, but entire <i>communities</i> of messy problems. Readers discouraged by seemingly inflexible barriers to solving complex social and technical problems can take heart after reading <i>Rescuing Prometheus</i>. This book shows that while we still can't fix the world, we're building better tools to do so every day. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>"Rescuing Prometheus is a remarkably well-detailed description of the organizing, developing, and executing of major and complex advanced technology projects that have greatly affected the society in the twentieth century. It is a particularly intelligent discussion of the leading personalities and other human factors that dominated the attainment of success in these endeavors."<br>--Simon Ramo, author of The Business of Science<br>"Hughes's research on large technical systems has made him the most influential living historian of technology.

Responsibility is claimed by a group supposedly demanding political separation from Britain, but as atrocities escalate, Head of CID Bob Skinner realizes this is no gang of fanatics, but a highly professional team.</p><p>Quintin Jardine was born once upon a time in the West - of Scotland rather than America, but still he grew to manhood as a massive Sergio Leone fan. On the way there he was educated, against his will, in Glasgow, where he ditched a token attempt to study law for more interesting careers in journalism, government propaganda, and political spin-doctoring. After a close call with the Brighton Bomb in 1984, he moved into the even riskier world of media relations consultancy, before realising that all along he had been training to become a crime writer. Now, forty novels later, he never looks back. Along the way he has created/acquired an extended family in Scotland and Spain. Everything he does is for them. He can be tracked down through his blog: http://quintinjardine.meDon't let Assistant Chief Constable Bob Skinner's affable exterior fool you. Underneath the surface, Skinner, who's head of Edinburgh's Criminal Investigation Department, is tough, uncompromising, and superb at his job, all of which was evident in his first case, <i>Skinner's Rules</i>. In this sequel, a bomb explodes at Edinburgh's nationally acclaimed International Arts Festival, and Skinner is first on the scene. A note delivered to Scotland's Secretary of State soon after the disaster indicates that the bomb is the work of an international terrorist group with a political agenda. Skinner uses every man under his command to initiate a search for the bombers, but he soon finds that the case is about much more than political terrorism. In fact, the treasures most precious to Scotland and to Skinner himself are the real targets. Tension mounts as more bombs explode, the body count increases, and Skinner's own wife and daughter are taken hostage by the terrorists. Scotsman Jardine writes a nearly flawless police procedural--intense, riveting, and relentlessly suspenseful--but his real forte is the way he gets into the minds and hearts of his characters.

Kennedy delivered an historic speech on mental illness and retardation. He described sweeping new programs to replace "the shabby treatment of the many millions of the mentally disabled in custodial institutions" with treatment in community mental health centers. This movement, later referred to as "deinstitutionalization," continues to impact mental health care. Though he never publicly acknowledged it, the program was a tribute to Kennedy's sister Rosemary, who was born mildly retarded and developed a schizophrenia-like illness. Terrified she'd become pregnant, Joseph Kennedy arranged for his daughter to receive a lobotomy, which was a disaster and left her severely retarded. </p><p>Fifty years after Kennedy's speech, E. Fuller Torrey's audiobook provides an inside perspective on the birth of the federal mental health program. On staff at the National Institute of Mental Health when the program was being developed and implemented, Torrey draws on his own first-hand account of the creation and launch of the program, extensive research, one-on-one interviews with people involved, and recently unearthed audiotapes of interviews with major figures involved in the legislation. As such, this book provides historical material previously unavailable to the public. </p><p>Many now wonder why public mental illness services are so ineffective. At least one-third of the homeless are seriously mentally ill, jails and prisons are grossly overcrowded, largely because the seriously mentally ill constitute 20 percent of prisoners, and public facilities are overrun by untreated individuals. As Torrey argues, it is imperative to understand how we got here in order to move forward towards providing better care for the most vulnerable.</p></p><p><br><strong>E. Fuller Torrey</strong> is Executive Director of the Stanley Medical Research Institute in Chevy Chase, MD, founder of the Treatment Advocacy Center, and Professor of Psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences.<br><br>"For a few days in September--after a psychotic gunman killed 12 people in Washington's Navy Yard--we were forced to ask ourselves, yet again, how we treat the seriously mentally ill in America and whether we need to rethink our policies and assumptions. No one is better equipped to address those questions than E. Fuller Torrey." --Sally Satel, <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"This is a powerful book on how to prevent the high profile tragedies that galvanize national attention, and the thousands of other tragedies that pass under the radar. I highly recommend it to all advocates and policymakers who care about mental illness." <br>--<em>Huffington Post</em><p></p><br>"This wise and unflinching book is an object lesson in good intentions gone awry on a grand scale. It should be widely read." --<em>New York Times</em><p></p><br>"An important book by a refreshingly candid author who shares his vast knowledge in the interests of the needy." --<em>Kirkus Reviews</em>, starred review<p></p><br>"Torrey is the conscience of the country and its most articulate spokesperson when it comes to public mental health care. His latest installment, <em>American Psychosis</em>, is a scathing analysis of the abject failure of U.S. mental health care policy written in his usual lucid and compelling style. Torrey is the Dorthea Dix of our time." -- Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD, President Elect, American Psychiatric Association; Lawrence C. Kolb Professor and Chairman of Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons; and Director, New York State Psychiatric Institute <br><p></p><br>"The first time I heard Torrey speak at a meeting of psychiatrists I was so offended I got up and left. Five years later I realized that everything he had said was true. This book will, I believe, offend many people; hopefully it will take them less time to recognize the truth of what Torrey has written." -- Alan A. Stone, MD, Former President of the American Psychiatric Association, Touroff-Glueck Professor of Law and Psychiatry in the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Medicine, Harvard University <br><p></p><br>"Torrey's superb new book is a devastating indictment of America's mental health 'system,' a story of good intentions gone disastrously awry. Torrey combines a deep professional knowledge of severe mental illness with an unparalleled understanding of the politics and policy of mental health. His lively writing weaves together powerful and poignant examples of the problem with hard-headed and yet compassionate solutions to one of America's greatest public policy tragedies." -- Stuart M. Butler, PhD, Distinguished Fellow and Director, Center for Policy Innovation, The Heritage Foundation <br><p></p><br>"With persuasive facts and gripping, tragic examples, Torrey documents what state psychiatric hospitals, community mental health centers, and jails have in common: millions of seriously mentally ill people treated inhumanely and inadequately, causing deterioration in the care of the most vulnerable. He examines the lessons learned from mental illness service programs over the past 50 years and concludes that we should greatly expand the best, such as proven programs in Wisconsin and New York City, and eliminate the worst, such as for-profit mental illness providers like nursing and board and care homes. American Psychosis is an unprecedented, invaluable elaboration of how to alter a national tragedy." -- Sidney M. Wolfe, MD, Public Citizen Health Research Group, Co-author of Worst Pills, Best Pills, and Editor, WorstPills.org <br><p></p><br>"Vintage Torrey: Comprehensive, deep, and thoughtful; biting and to the point; yet hopeful and hoping for change." -- John A. Talbott, MD, Professor of Psychiatry, University of Maryland School of Medicine <br><p></p><br>"The author successfully weaves in political, social, and medical influences of the time, permitting readers to comprehend the challenges faced during this period. It is clear the author has a passion for this subject, and he provides solid conclusions that should leave readers wondering when, if not now, is the appropriate time to overhaul the system once again." -Steven T.

In Koppelman&#x2019;s new novel, Dr. Susanna Seliger is a renowned psychiatrist who specializes in treatment-resistant depression. The most difficult cases come through her door, and Susa is always ready to discuss treatment options, medication, and symptom management but draws the line at engaging with feelings. A strict adherence to protocol keeps her from falling apart. But her past is made present by one patient, Jim, whose struggles tear open Susa&#x2019;s hastily stitched up wounds, revealing her latent feeling that she could have helped the people closest to her, especially her adored, cool, talented graffiti-artist brother. Spectacularly original, gorgeously unsettling, HESITATION WOUNDS is a novel that will sink deep and remain&#x2015;like a persistent scar or a dangerous glow-in-the-dark memory.</p><p>Amy Koppelman is a graduate of Columbia&#39;s MFA program. Her writing has appeared in The New York Observer and Lilith. She lives in New York City with her husband, Brian Koppelman, and their two children. Her previous novels are A Mouthful of Air and I Smile Back, which premiered at Sundance Film Festival and starred Sarah Silverman.&#x201c;<em>Hesitation Wounds</em>&nbsp;reads like a fever dream, or the last second of a deeply feeling woman's life. It is full of brilliantly observed pain and truth. It is an in-depth unblinking report on the deepest of all bonds, familial love. It is spare but it is also somehow full. Its truths are so sharp I began to read with my head slightly averted, as if expecting the next blow. She is way more unflinching than you or me. Her language is simple, deceptively so, the further she goes, as if depth stole oxygen and there was only so much breath left for words, so they had better be true. And they are true. It's a jagged, dangerous, beautiful book that affirms life even as it affirms the impossibility of life. Like Beckett, she can't go on, she will go on.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Duchovny, author of Holy Cow</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Amy Koppelman has wrangled into the world a marvel of a book in terms of language and character and story.

Her snapshot images build on each other, creating a kaleidoscope of Susa&#x2019;s life.

When 15-year-old student Megumi fails to arrive home from school her mother calls on her dead husband&#39;s best friend for help. Shiga abandons his mountain refuge and enters the city to look for the girl - and with the police investigation at a standstill, Shiga has to go it alone.</p><p>Jiro Taniguchi was born 1947 in Tottori, Japan. He trained in the 60&#39;s and debuted in 1971 in &#39;Young Comic&#39;. During the 70&#39;s he worked with author Natsuo Sekikawa before launching into their massive work &#39;The times of Botchan&#39; in the 80&#39;s. The 90&#39;s saw many solo works including the prize winning &#39;A Distant Neighborhood&#39;. The new millenium saw Taniguchi&#39;s epic adaptation of Baku Yumemakura&#39;s novel &#39;The Summit of the Gods&#39; into a 1500 page manga. He continues to live and work in Japan.Given that Taniguchi is the creator of and artist for many accomplished works of nouvelle manga such as <i>The Walking Man</i> and <i>Ice Wanderer</i>, this mystery manga falls short. The rather uninventive story line finds mountaineer Shiga traveling to Tokyo to find his friend's 15-year-old daughter, who has gone missing. Taniguchi, whose usual work reflects a fascination and great respect for nature and the overwhelming feelings that it can conjure, feels out of step with this book. The project excels in the mountain scenes and flashbacks, but flattens out in the flashy lights of Tokyo. Like Shiga, Taniguchi seems to feel out of place with the big city, outside of and uncomfortable with its rhythms. Very much a product of its time (<i>Quest</i> was first published in Japan in 1999), Taniguchi treats compensated dating (a practice of older men giving younger women gifts in exchange for companionship or sex, common in Japan in the 1990s) with a heavy hand. He also implements larger-than-life scenarios that, while staples in manga, feel clumsy in his hand. Taniguchi's art is ever beautiful, but like the storytelling here, it simply doesn't grip the reader the way his other works do. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

By the end of the decade scores of new projects stood vacant. They were see-through buildings, towering symbols of the collapsing economy of a state that had for a time seemed to embody the nation's vitality. Once a promising architectural laboratory, the landscape had become a study in blighted expectations.<br>Joel Barna incisively reveals the links between architecture, economics, and contemporary American beliefs. Interweaving his analysis with more than 120 black-and-white photographs and 50 drawings, he scrutinizes the RepublicBank Center in Houston, the Allied Bank Tower in Dallas, the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, and many other structures.<br>Texas's architecture and urban growth not only form a physical record of the boom and bust of the decade; they point beyond the borders of the state to trends and developments that will affect the country into the next century. This is a book not just about Texas, but about our future.</p><p>&#x201c;Land was developed and buildings were built for the simple reason that money was available . . . Joel Barna . . . chronicles this boisterous period with clear, critical judgment. . . . Much of the architectural theory of the Postmodern era has centered on meaning&#x2014;the conveyance by architecture of societal symbols through association with historical styles. Barna dismisses this theoretical pretext by clarifying the real function of buildings placed on the land. `Real estate is an engine,&#x2019; says Barna, `powered by money . . . &#x2019;Buildings are put up not so much to fulfill functional needs as to enhance the value of the land, to become real estate commodities. This is not what architects like to hear. But evidence is abundant in our era that the message of the medium is simply to call attention to itself.&#x201d;--Gerald Moorhead (Gerald Moorhead)</p><h2>Nude</h2><p>Stefan Rappo's nude photography strikes an intriguing note between intimacy and distance.

SPECTATORA sure and illuminating guide. SUNDAY TIMESThe city state of Florence led the rest of the western world in art, science and political idealism in the middle ages. This early richness, the importance of the achievements of its famous sons, including Dante, Giotto, Leonardo and Michelangelo, the great quantity of visible remains, make Florence as a city to visit both alluring and challenging. In true Companion Guide manner, this book describes, with the knowledge and insight distilled from long residence in Florence, and with an art historian&#39;s eye, what is to be seen and its place in history. In discussing the Florentine monuments and their origins in the city&#39;s life, EVE BORSOOK presents a study of the ideas, events and personalities of Florence yesterday and today; she communicates to the visitor her delight in her chosen city, including those districts usually neglected by the tourist but particularly rich in Florentine life.</p><p>OF THE GREAT CITIES of the world, Florence is, and always has been, small, but has nevertheless led the world in art, science and political idealism from the middle ages to modern times. Dante, Giotto, Brunelleschi, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Galileo and so many other giants were all Florentines; the importance of their achievements and the great quantity of visible remains which they have left behind, along with an idyllic setting, make Florence uniquely attractive. Eve Borsook, an art historian living in the city, unravels Florence&#39;s history in chapters devoted to each neighbourhood. Her perfect day in Florence includes a church, a stroll through a market, a visit to a craftsman in his workshop, a museum -- and a picnic; with this guide to hand, the visitor to Florence may follow suit.EVE BORSOOK is a research associate at Harvard&#39;s Center for Italian Renaissance Studies at Villa I Tatti in Florence.</p><h2>X-Men Legacy Vol. 2: Sins of the Father</h2><p>Xavier traces his history and the history of the X-Men to the core.

Documenting a startling new discovery, this exquisitely produced book unveils 204 major prints and drawings that have been sequestered in a private collection for nearly half a century.</p><br><p>Sometime before 1914, as Cassatt neared the end of her career, she was coaxed into selling her "studio collection"--etchings, monotypes, color aquatints, and drawings that she had kept for sentimental or archival purposes--to the dealer Ambroise Vollard. He added a few pieces to the collection from other notable Cassatt fans, including her friend Edgar Degas. When World War I disrupted the art market, Vollard tucked this remarkable collection away and never exhibited it before his death on the eve of World War II. The entire group was acquired by a French collector, who showed only a few works to friends and selected members of the art community.</p><br><p>Many of the prints, which are in pristine condition, are previously unknown variants of Cassatt's work; others have never before been seen in any version. Because Cassatt's output as a printmaker was quite small and because her color prints are praised for being among her most radically innovative works, this discovery is an extraordinary event in an art world where demand for Cassatt&#x2019;s art seems insatiable.</p><br><p>The catalogue section of the book documents in exacting detail and in superb illustrations the 41 color prints, 127 black-and-white prints, and 36 drawings that constitute what is now known as the studio collection. Essays by leading experts tell the story of this rare collection and explore Cassatt&#x2019;s virtuosity as a printmaker. The result is an important and unusually beautiful publication that will intensify interest in this much-loved artist and stimulate a new appreciation of her significant contributions to modern printmaking.</p></p><p><p><b>Warren Adelson</b> is President of Adelson Galleries and a member of the <i>catalogue raisonn�</i> committees for John Singer Sargent and Mary Cassatt.

There, a doorway, open to a select few, leads into the past-or the grave. Claire Randall survived the extraordinary passage, not once but twice. Her first trip swept her into the arms of Jamie Fraser, an eighteenth-century Scot whose love for her became legend-a tale of tragic passion that ended with her return to the present to bear his child. Her second journey, two decades later, brought them together again in frontier America. But Claire had left someone behind in the twentieth century. Their daughter, Brianna.... Now Brianna has made a disturbing discovery that sends her to the stone circle and a terrifying leap into the unknown. In search of her mother and the father she has never met, she is risking her own future to try to change history...and to save their lives. But as Brianna plunges into an uncharted wilderness, a heartbreaking encounter may strand her forever in the past...or root her in the place she should be, where her heart and soul belong.... From the bestselling author of Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber, and Voyager comes the exquisite fourth novel in the romantic, time-travel tale of Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall. 1767: On the even of the American Revolution, Jamie and Claire land on the shores of Charleston to begin a new life. Jamie, determined to stay away from the rumblings of a war that is not his own, soon realizes that war spares no one--and that love is worth fighting for. The long-anticipated continuation of the best-selling, century-spanning family saga.</p><p>Set in pre-Revolutionary War America, readers finally have the much awaited fourth book in what will probably become a six book series (The Outlander series). The talented Diana Gabaldon continues Claire and Jamie's romantic love affair, and introduces Brianna and Roger's story. Eight hundred pages, and several wonderful new characters later, we wonder why we were waiting for a conclusion.

Virginia&#39;s college asked her to leave. Her parents put on a wedding. And now? Well, as Virginia puts it, &#34;now that we know each other a little better it turns out we are actually strangers.&#34; Set in 1960, AN ACTUAL LIFE, is about the second summer of Buddy and Virginia&#39;s marriage. There&#39;s no money, no love, no foreseeable future. They both try hard, but Virginia is all of nineteen and Buddy only just past twenty and neither one has a clue how to make this misbegotten marriage work. The way it ends is both a complete surprise and utterly inevitable.</p><p>"It is too bad marriage doesn't come with attachments like a vacuum cleaner. You can't do anything with ours. Ours just sits there and blows hot air," says Virginia, the 19-year-old narrator of <i>An Actual Life</i>. Having gotten pregnant in the late 1950s after a single night of not so blissful sex, she is now mired in a joyless marriage. Her young husband Buddy works, goes to school, and ignores her, preferring to spend free time with his high school girlfriend Irene, whose marriage to Buddy's best friend Chick seems just as much of a sham. In the meantime, Virginia plays with their daughter Madeline, repeats every superstition she's ever heard--passing on the stairs is bad luck, a dropped knife heralds a man's arrival--and obsessively charts Buddy's comings and goings. Quirky humor makes the reader laugh and wince, while adept characterization and flowing prose add up to a wonderful, featherweight novel.ABIGAIL THOMAS is the author of Safekeeping, a memoir, as well as a novel and two story collections.

Masur (history, City College of New York) explores the anticipation, the observation, and the excitement it raised at a critical moment in the history of the US. Among the themes he identifies are slavery and abolition, tension between states&#39; rights and national priorities, the competing passions of religion and politics, and the effects of new machinery on the relationship to the land. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p><b>Louis P. Masur</b>, professor of history at the City College of New York and editor of <i>Reviews in American History</i>, is the author of <i>Rites of Execution: Capital Punishment and the Transformation of American Culture, 1776-1865</i>. He lives in New Jersey.1831 <br> ECLIPSE &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Everyone knew it was coming. "THE GREAT ECLIPSE OF 1831 will be one of the most remarkable that will again be witnessed in the United States for a long course of years," alerted <i>Ash's Pocket Almanac.</i> One editor reported that the February 12 eclipse would even surpass historic occasions when "the darkness was such that domestic fowls retired to roost" and "it appeared as if the moon rode unsteadily in her orbit, and the earth seemed to tremble on its axis."1 On the day of the eclipse, from New England through the South, Americans looked to the heavens. One diarist saw "men, women and children ... in all directions, with a piece of smoked glass, and eyes turn'd upward." The <i>Boston Evening Gazette</i> reported that "this part of the world has been all anxiety ... to witness the solar eclipse ... . Business was suspended and thousands of persons were looking at the phenomena with intense curiosity." "Every person in the city," noted the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i>, "was star gazing, from bleary-eyed old age to the most bright-eyed infancy."2 Unlike previous celestial events, thought some commentators, the eclipse of 1831 would not produce superstitious dread that the world would end. "Idle fears and gloomy forebodings of evil formerly raised by the appearance of phenomena caused by the regular operation of natural laws," one writer claimed, "have yielded to pleasing admiration; a change which the march of science and general diffusion of knowledge have largely contributed to effect." Another writer mocked the notion that eclipses were "signs or forerunners of great calamities." Eclipses, he thought, "necessarily result from the established laws of the planetary revolution, and take place in exact conformity with those laws ... . Those who entertain the opinion that eclipses of the sun are tokens of the Divine displeasure can produce no warrant from scripturefor their irrational belief. If we would look for the signs of the displeasure of God towards a nation, we can see them, not in eclipses, but in national sins and depravity of morals."3 Rational explanations of atmospheric events, however, offered little solace to most Americans. In many, "a kind of vague fear, of impending danger--a prophetic presentiment of some approaching catastrophe"--was awakened, and "the reasonings of astronomy, or the veritable deductions of mathematical forecast," did little to diminish the anxiety. One correspondent reported that an "old shoe-black accosted a person in front of our office, the day previous to the eclipse, and asked him if he was not afraid. For, said he, with tears in his eyes, the world is to be destroyed to-morrow; the sun and moon are to meet ... and a great earthquake was to swallow us all!--Others said the sun and the earth would come in contact, and the latter would be consumed. Others again, were seen wending their ways to their friends and relations, covered with gloom and sadness; saying that they intended to <i>die with them</i>!" The day after the eclipse, preachers employed Luke 21:25 as the text for their sermons: "there shall be signs in the sun." "In strict propriety of language," one minister observed, "it is not the sun that is eclipsed. Not the slightest shadow is cast upon the least portion of his broad disk. His beams are shot forth precisely the same. It is over us only that the momentary darkness is spread, and it is truly the earth that is eclipsed."4 The spectacle, however, proved anticlimactic. "The darkness being less visible than generally expected," the heaven-gazers felt "bamboozled." "At the moment of greatest obscuration," reported one paper, "a foolish feeling of disappointment was generally prevalent and this was expressed by many in such terms as they might have used after having been taken in by the quacking advertisement of an exhibitor of fireworks or phantasmagoria. It was not half as dark as they expected." "The darkness was that of a thunder gust," snorted one observer: "The light of the sun was sickly, but shadows were very perceptible." "The multitude have been sadly disappointed," reported one editor. "They looked for darkness and the shades of light; they expected to drink inhorrors, and feel the power of superstition without its terrors or apprehensions; they expected to work by candlelight, see cows come home, and poultry go ultimately to roost--to count the stars and tell them by their names; in short, to see something that they might talk about now and hereafter--something to tell their children and grandchildren."5 With the anticipation more disturbing than the event, some sought to cast blame. Almanac makers and newspaper editors were chastised for their extravagant predictions of darkness and glowing descriptions of the wonders that would be seen. Some thought the astronomers deserved condemnation for offering elaborate calculations that fizzled. Others blamed regional temperaments for the heightened expectations. "Our Yankee proneness to exaggeration," thought the <i>Boston Patriot</i>, "was manifested in a ludicrous manner on the occasion of the late eclipse." Southerners agreed: "Our eastern brethren are, as usual, up in arms about the matter--they talk of a convention. Truth to say, expectations were scarcely realized. On such occasions, people now-a-day show a shockingly morbid appetite--they look for portentous signs, for ghastly gleanings of fiery comets, the rushing up, with dire intimations of the 'northern lights,' and expect to see 'clouds of dark blood to blot the sun's broad light, / And angry meteors shroud the world in night.'"6 However much the eclipse disappointed, it served as metaphor and omen. Edward Everett, politician from Massachusetts, reported that "a motion was made in the House of Representatives to adjourn over till Monday in consequence of the darkness which was to prevail." The motion did not pass, and Everett quipped, "After sitting so frequently when there is darkness inside the House, it would be idle I think to fly before a little darkness on the face of the heavens." The <i>United States Gazette</i>, which feverishly opposed the re-election of President Andrew Jackson, joked that "the solar eclipse has not attracted as much attention here, as the late curious obscuration of one of the smaller stars in the constellation, Jupiter Jackson." With greater sobriety, the editor of the <i>Philadelphia Gazette</i> observed that "the affairs of the Eastern hemisphere ... have reached a thrilling and portentous crisis. An irresistiblespirit of reform seems burning with occult but mighty energy among the nations ... . An eclipse in Europe at the present time might be considered as an omen. In this country, where it has lately occurred, the sunshine of regulated freedom appears alone to rest."7 Unmoved by editorial, ministerial, astronomical, or political pronouncements and predictions, on the day of the eclipse some Philadelphians went ice-skating. The coldest winter in decades had frozen the Delaware River, and thousands of citizens chose to pass the day in recreation. The <i>Saturday Bulletin</i> reported, "It is probable that fifteen thousand persons were amusing themselves by sliding and skating on the river, while the numerous booths, or travelling dram-shops which were located at short distances apart, throughout the whole city front, were observed to do a brisk business in hot punch, smoked sausages, crackers, and ten-for-a-cent cigars. Sober citizens, whom we have observed never exceed a regular dog-trot, while walking our streets, were now capering around with the agility of a feather in a whirlwind."8 One artist drew the scene. On February 12, Edward William Clay set up his easel by the Delaware River and produced an image of citizens at play. Men of all classes slip and swirl, some into one another's arms, as they skate the day away. To the right, a rough-hewn citizen warms himself with a drink; a woman looks on contentedly. A black man, in stereotypical comic fashion, slides helplessly away, his hat lost. All is movement and motion, energy and action. But the sky is gray, the light is pale, and dusk is approaching.

Hedge funds, pension funds, and other institutions have always used relative strength investing to rack up big returns, yet the methodology has never been presented to the individual investor as a viable, easy-to-understand investment strategy, as it is in this book. Michael Carr, a personal investor with a longtime background in system design and analysis, has applied his professional expertise to investing. After running millions of relative strength calculations, Carr proves that relative strength investing works in any market climate. By strictly following his methodologies outlined in this book, you can more than double the returns of the S&amp;P 500, with less risk. Carr shares his results, methodology, and step-by-step instructions here in this book. Smarter Investing in Any Economy: The Definitive Guide to Relative Strength Investing will show you how relative strength strategies allow you to invest successfully in both bull and bear markets. Even in a market downturn, something is always going up. Relative strength will help you pinpoint that stock, currency, or commodity that s on its way up. Recent advances in computing capability and the widespread availability of ETFs have now opened up relative strength strategies to virtually any investor. Relative strength has been widely used for years by financial institutions; however, it was never accessible to individual investors because of complex custom programming requirements. Computing advances, coupled with new ETFs that limit risk have made relative strength a viable strategy for long-term investors and day traders alike. Carr has broken down his technique to the level that any Microsoft user can implement his strategies successfully.</p><p>Michael Carr has been trading for more than twenty years and is a chartered market technician. Carr began researching relative strength trading more than a decade ago and after retiring from the U.S. Air Force as a Lieutenant Colonel, he became a full-time relative strength investor. He is the editor of the Market Technicians Association (MTA) monthly newsletter, Technically Speaking, and associate editor of the MTA&#39;s scholarly publication, Journal of Technical Analysis. Carr also serves on the board of directors of the MTA Educational Foundation. His work has been published in SFO, Futures, TRADERS , and Working Money. Carr lives in northern Colorado with his fiancée, Eileen, and their English springer spaniel, Bandit.Michael Carr's terrific <i>Smarter Investing in Any Economy: The Definitive Guide to Relative Strength Investing</i> is out and it is well worth reading. First of all, it is a good survey of the literature, much of which is forty or more years old and obscure today. Second, it does a nice job of presenting the basic relative strength concepts and building on them gradually in a comprehensible manner. Finally, he presents and tests some systematic relative strength ideas and sets the reader up in a manner that will facilitate success. Along the way Mr. Carr highlights the work of interesting contemporary practitioners such as Clay Allen and outlines some of many different approaches that are in use today. All in all, this book has something for the reader interested in relative strength, no matter whether an experienced professional or a relative novice. --John Bollinger, Capital Growth Letter (June 2008)</p><h2>After the War Is Over: A Novel</h2><p><p>The International bestselling author of <em>Somewhere in France </em>returns with her sweeping second novel&#x2014;a tale of class, love, and freedom&#x2014;in which a young woman must find her place in a world forever changed.</p><p>After four years as a military nurse, Charlotte Brown is ready to leave behind the devastation of the Great War.

He is famous for his monumental paintings of phenomena, powerful works that capture the grandeur of nature and extend the tradition of landscape painting in Canada. According to Michael Ondaatje, "Perhaps there is a balance and security in these precarious works because of the very fact that they seem to have been torn out of the heart and earth."</p><p>Born in Montreal in 1925, Paterson Ewen was heralded as one of the leading modern artists in Quebec. In 1968, he moved to London, Ontario, where he still lived and worked at the time of publication. Ewen's work is in the collections of most public art institutations in Canada and has been exhibited widely in North America and Europe. He was chosen to represent Canada at the 1982 Venice Biennale, and his numerous honours include the Chalmers Award for Visual Arts and the Toronto Arts Award.</p><p>This beautifully produced volume presents a selection of Ewen's most important works (50 in full colour and 72 in black and white), as well as four texts celebrating a career that spans six decades.</p><p>Michael Ondaatje's introduction reflects on the act of making art and is rooted in his response to Ewen's works. Ron Graham's biographical essay presents much new information on Ewen and his community of artists in Montreal and London. Matthew Teitelbaum's critical essay examines Ewen's career, his development, influences and achievement. Eric Fischl's afterword offers a personal view of his friendship with Ewen.</p><p><i>This book was published in partnership with the Art Gallery of Ontario.</i></p></p><p><b>Matthew Teitelbaum</b>, Director of the Art Gallery of Ontario and formerly curator at The Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, MS, has organized a range of Canadian and international exhibitions including <i>Paterson Ewen: Early Weathers/Heavenly Skies</i> (AGO) in 1996. <p><strong>Michael Ondaatje</strong> is an internationally acclaimed writer and winner of hte Booker Prize for his novel <i>The English Patient</i>. His numerous other books include <i>In the Skin of a Lion</i> and the autobiography <i>Running in the Family</i>.</p> <b>Ron Graham</b> is a best-selling Canadian author, whose books include <i>The French Quarter</i>, <i>One Eyed Kings</i>, and <i>In God's Dominion</i>. <b>Eric Fischl</b>, the celebrated American figurative painter, was a colleague of Paterson Ewen when both taught at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in the late 1970s.</p><h2>The Road to 1945</h2><p>The Road to 1945 is a rigorously researched study of the crucial moment when political parties put aside their differences to unite under Churchill and focus on the task of war. But the war years witnessed a radical shift in political power - dramatically expressed in Labour&#39;s decisive electoral victory in 1945. In his acclaimed study, Paul Addison reconstructs and interprets the five-year wartime coalition, and traces this sea-change from its roots in the thirties, to the powerful spirit of post-war rebuilding.The Road to 1945 is an imaginative, brilliantly written and landmark work, underpinned by a powerful and expertly researched argument.</p><p></p><h2>When the Sky Fell In Search of Atlantis</h2><p>Did Atlantis really exsist? If so,where was it,and what happened to it? Inspired by the theory that at various stages in prehistory the earths crust shifted dramatically,causing violent earthquakes,tidal waves,devastating climatic changes,the authors examine the clues as to the location of Atlantis entrusted to Plato by Egyptian priests,the extraordinary similarities between myths from around the world,and ancient and amazingly accurate maps of South America and ice free Antarctica that date long before the first European explorers ever reached those shores.They conclude that a civilisation of highly intelligent seafarers did exists some twelve thousand years ago,but was destroy ed,by a geological disaster,leaving only a few survivors to safeguard its relicsand legends for posterity.</p><p>ANCIENT MYSTERIES / NEW AGE <br> <br>&#x201c;An excellent book that is not only beautifully researched but also extremely entertaining to read. The Flem-Aths&#x2019; theory on Atlantis will go down in the annals of this subject as one of the most convincing and imaginative. Well done for the first-class tour de force.&#x201d; <br>--Robert Bauval, author of <em>Black Genesis </em>and <em>The Orion Mystery</em> <br> <br>In this completely revised and expanded edition of <em>When the Sky Fell</em>, Rand and Rose Flem-Ath show that 12,000 years ago vast areas of Antarctica were free from ice and home to the kingdom of Atlantis, a proposition that also elegantly solves the mysteries of ice ages and mass extinctions, the simultaneous worldwide rise of agriculture, and the source of devastating prehistoric climate change. Expanding upon Charles Hapgood&#x2019;s theory of earth crust displacement, which was championed by Albert Einstein, they examine ancient yet highly accurate world maps, including the Piri Reis map of 1513, and show how the earth&#x2019;s crust shifted in 9600 BCE, dragging Atlantis into the polar zone where it now lies beneath miles of Antarctic ice. From the Cherokee, Haida, and Okanagan of North America to the earliest records of Egypt, Iran, Mexico, and Japan, they reveal that ancient myths of floods, lost island paradises, and visits from advanced godlike peoples from all corners of the globe all point to the same worldwide catastrophe that resulted in Atlantis&#x2019;s demise. The authors explain how the remaining Atlanteans, amid massive earthquakes and epic floods, evacuated and spread throughout the world, resulting in the birth of the first known civilizations. <br> <br>Including rare material from the archives of Charles Hapgood, Albert Einstein, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Flem-Aths explain how an earth crust displacement could happen again in the future, perhaps in correspondence with high solar activity. With new scientific, genetic, and linguistic evidence in support of Antarctica as the location of long-lost Atlantis, this updated edition convincingly shows that Atlantis was not swallowed by the sea but was entombed beneath miles of polar ice. <br> <br>RAND FLEM-ATH is a librarian and coauthor of <em>The Atlantis Blueprint</em>.

At the same time, the biblical worldview has been pushed to the margins. Christians have been strongly influenced by these trends, with the result that the personal lives of Christians often reflect the surrounding culture more than the way of Christ, and the church&#39;s transforming influence on society has waned. In Kingdom Triangle, J.P. Moreland issues a call to recapture the drama and power of kingdom living. He examines and provides a penetrating critique of these worldviews and shows how they have ushered in the current societal crisis. He then lays out a strategy for the Christian community to regain the potency of kingdom life and influence in the world. Drawing insights from the early church, he outlines three essential ingredients of this revolution: ? Recovery of the Christian mind ? Renovation of Christian spirituality ? Restoration of the power of the Holy Spirit He believes that evangelical Christianity can mature and lead the surrounding society out of the meaningless morass it finds itself in with humility and vision.</p><p>J. P. Moreland is one of the leading evangelical thinkers of our day. He is distinguished professor of philosophy at Talbot School of Theology and director of Eidos Christian Center. With degrees in philosophy, theology, and chemistry, Dr. Moreland has taught theology and philosophy at several schools throughout the U.S. He has authored or coauthored many books, including Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview; Christianity and the Nature of Science; Scaling the Secular City; Does God Exist?; The Lost Virtue of Happiness; and Body and Soul. He is coeditor of Jesus Under Fire: Modern Scholarship Reinvents the Historical Jesus. His work appears in publications such as Christianity Today, Faith and Philosophy, Philosophia Christi, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, and The American Philosophical Quarterly.

In <i>How to Write a Selling Screenplay,</i> he takes writers through the entire process, from developing a story to finding the best agent. Using an annotated version of an often-optioned screenplay of his own, and citing examples from movies ranging from <i>Casablanca</i> and <i>Lethal Weapon</i> to <i>Sling Blade</i> and <i>The English Patient,</i> he discusses how to create three-dimensional characters, find a compelling story, build an airtight plot structure, fine-tune dialogue, and much more. Keane's tips on the difference between writing for film and television, as well as his advice on dealing with Hollywood movers and shakers, make this an essential companion for people writing their first--or their fortieth--screenplay.</p><p>"Keane's HOW TO WRITE A SELLING SCREENPLAY is certain to become the standard book for aspiring young authors. It covers every aspect of the screenwriting process from initial conception to the completion of the script, finding an agent, and placing the project with a production company. A masterful contribution from a leading authority." (James Nagel, writer, HEMINGWAY IN LOVE AND WAR, Eidson Distinguished Professor, The University of Georgia) <p>"Chris Keane's book, HOW TO WRITE A SELLING SCREENPLAY, is the new bible on the art of writing screenplays. It is a must for any new or experienced writer." (Michael Pressman, Executive Producer, PICKET FENCES) </p><p>"Keane's book is a method, a set of observations, from which an aspiring writer can discover his own approach: an approach to discipline, to work habits, most importantly--a discovery of process--so that if there is any talent there and a personal vision, it has a chance to survive and find a practical means of expression. Comprehensive, instructive, and filled with illuminating and helpful personal anecdotes." (Marshall Brickman, screenwriter. MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY, ANNIE HALL; cowriter, MANHATTAN, SLEEPER) </p><p>"Keane effectively combines theoretical considerations with hands-on applications that are easy to understand. His experience as an educator is abundantly evident on every page." (Richard Walter, professor and Screenwriting Chairman, UCLA) </p><p>"Keane has written a great guide to screenwriting. If all young screenwriters and studio execs would read it, American movies would be better." (Ralph Rosenblum, professor of Film at Columbia University Graduate Film School and editor of Goodbye, Columbus; Annie Hall; and Sleeper) </p><p>"To call this a book about screenwriting is to underestimate it enormously. It is about good writing and each superb rule and suggestion can be used for plays, novels, TV, and movies. I greatest accolade I can give is to say, 'I wish I had written it." (Stanley Ralph Ross, writer, The Bill Cosby Show, Columbo)</p>There are a lot of fine "how to write a screenplay" titles out and about, but what makes Keane's How To Write a Selling Screenplay unique is the examination on a step-by-step basis of a screenplay, The Crossing, that the author wrote. The teacher/pupil-type exchange, as you closely examine the screenplay, reads almost as if you were asking pertinent questions in class at just the right moments. Keane discusses each screenwriting point (opening sequence, inciting incident, plot point #1, etc.) as it occurs in his screenplay. This makes for twice the fun as you learn solid screenwriting tactics and get to read a thrilling story to boot! Wilson's Inside Hollywood is an eclectic sampling of Tinseltown, never too much information, never quite enough, but a perfect starting point for anyone interested in the motion picture industry. This survival guide to the biz also comes in a format unlike anything this reviewer has ever seen before. Where else will you find the history of Hollywood, an overview of the movie and television industries, and an examination of various film-related job titles, salaries, etc., while taking a quick look at the city of Los Angeles itself? Both books are well written and are essential for strengthening your movie-writing collection.?Marty D.

A major book which will stand alongside such successful works of popular scholarship as Simon Schama&#39;s Citizens, Rob Hughes The shock of the New Orlando Figes&#39; A peoples tragedy.</p><p>Every golden age has been an urban age; throughout history, cities have provided a crucible for creativity. How do such <i>belles �poques</i>come about? Why should the creative flame burn so uniquely in cities and not in the countryside, and why does the creative and innovative spirit of one city inevitably yield to another? <i>Cities in Civilization</i> explores these issues and others related to the central role of cities, past and present, in the fostering of artistic, philosophical, scientific, and technological genius.<p> Peter Hall devoted 15 years of his life conceptualizing, researching, and writing <i>Cities in Civilization</i>. His extraordinary efforts are apparent in the analytical scope, historical depth, and sheer length of the book, which, including photographs and a bibliography, is well over 1,000 pages. Supporting his argument with ample reference to dates, historical figures, and citations of leading urban scholars, the book does not lend itself to casual, cover-to-cover reading. Despite the book's length, though, it remains easy to navigate through the case studies of individual cities. Hall systematically divides the text into five thematic chapters, further subdividing each chapter chronologically by city. The chapters explore themes of cultural creativity, technological and economic innovation, the urban fusion of art and technology, urban innovation, and the partnership of the private and public sector to promote urban development and regeneration.</p><p> Breaking from other leading scholars in the field, Hall does not consider the great city doomed. Instead, <i>Cities in Civilization</i> testifies to his confidence that cities of the 21st century, like the great cities of the past, will successfully work to solve their own problems and ameliorate their own ills. <i>--Bertina Loeffler</i></p>2,500 years, <b>Cities in Civilization</b> is a tribute to the city as the birthplace of Western civilization. Drawing on the contributions of economists and geographers, of cultural, technological, and social historians, Sir Peter Hall examines twenty-one cities at their greatest moments. Hall describes the achievements of these golden ages and outlines the precise combinations of forces -- both universal and local -- that led to each city's belle epoque.<br><br>Hall identifies four distinct expressions of civic innovation: artistic growth, technological progress, the marriage of culture and technology, and solutions to evolving problems. Descriptions of Periclean Athens, Renaissance Florence, Elizabethan London, and nineteenth-century Vienna bring to life those seedbeds of artistic and intellectual creativity. Explorations of Manchester during the Industrial Revolution, of Henry Ford's Detroit, and of Palo Alto at the dawn of the computer age highlight centers of technological advances.</p><h2>The first day on the Somme, 1 July 1916</h2><p>On 1 July, 1916, a continous line of British soldiers climbed out from the trenches of the Somme into No Man&#39;s Land and began to walk slowly towards dug-in German troops armed with machine-guns and defended by thick barbed wire. By the end of that day, as old tactics were met by the reality of modern warfare, there had been more than 60,000 British casualties - a third of them fatalities. Martin Middlebrook&#39;s classic account of the blackest day in the history of the British army draws on official sources, local newspapers, autobiographies, novels and poems from the time. Most importantly, it also takes in the accounts of hundreds of survivors: normal men, many of them volunteers, who found themselves thrown into a scene of unparalleled tragedy and horror. Compelling and intensely moving, it describes the true events behind the sacrifice of a generation of young men - killed as much by the folly of their commanders as by the bullets of their enemies.</p><p><b>Martin Middlebrook</b> is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and the author of <i>The Battle of Hamburg: The Firestorm Raid</i>, <i>The Berlin Raids</i>, and <i>Convoy: The Greatest U-Boat Battle of the War</i>."The soldiers receive the best service a historian can provide: their story is told in their own words." &#x2014;<i>Guardian</i><br><br>"A particularly vivid and personal narrative." &#x2014;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"Pioneering and hauntingly eloquent." &#x2014;Peter Parker, <i>Spectator</i></p><h2>Loosening the Bonds: Mid-Atlantic Farm Women, 1750-1850</h2><p>The first book to investigate the rich and complex lives of rural women during the late colonial and early national periods.&nbsp; Jensen focuses on women in the Philadelphia hinterland and shows how they became an essential part of that area&#x2019;s rise to agricultural prominence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Examining not only the Quakers, who formed the dominant group in the region, but also black and other ethnic groups, Jensen offers fascinating details on the ways farm women functioned in the varied spheres of their lives.&nbsp; Her book makes a major contribution to women&#x2019;s history.</p><p>The first book to investigate the rich and complex lives of rural women during the late colonial and early national periods.

Filled with 125 tantalizing and sometimes challenging recipes, Loha-unchit covers not only basic cooking tenets but explores how to create dishes that balance the Thai people's love of the five primary flavors: salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy.<p> Many of the recipes feature flavors not common in Western cooking, but Loha-unchit teaches you how to create a savory meal in which the disparate tastes work in harmony. In addition to the recipes, there are chapters on Thailand's seafood culture, how to select and prepare seafood, preserved foods and flavoring ingredients (like fish sauce, a staple item), and techniques and equipment. For those unfamiliar with fish sauce or shrimp paste, she explains how they are made, her favorite brands, and where you can purchase them (there's a store index in the back).</p><p> The recipes themselves are mouth-watering: Hot-and-Sour Shrimp Salad with Roasted Chilli Sauce, Lemon Grass, and Mint, Curried Mussels on the Half Shell with Flaked Crab, and Ginger-Tamarind Fish Soup, to name only a few. Though some of the recipes may seem daunting at first, Loha-unchit reminds us that "the wide range of variables makes Thai cooking exciting and Thai food both a simple and complex blend of invigorating flavors." After all, it's hard to resist Garlic-Black Bean Pan-Fried Red Snapper. Be sure to serve with a big pot of sticky white rice. <i>--Dana Van Nest</i></p><b>Kasma Loha-unchit,</b> a native of Thailand, has taught Thai cooking in her own home-based cooking school in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1985.

The minimalist process emphasizes the importance of first knowing what you want to achieve as a photographer and then choosing the most effective equipment, subject matter, and general approach to meet your goals. The minimalist photographer works with the idea that the brain and the eye are far more important than the camera. <br><br>Author Steve Johnson begins by asking you, the reader, to look inward and make the connections between your nature and your photography. Why do you want to take photographs and what subject matter are you attracted to? What type of photographer are you now and what type of photographer would you like to become? These are important questions to consider when deciding what approach works best for you. <br><br>In subsequent chapters, you'll learn about the equipment and workflow of a minimalist photographer as Johnson discusses the strengths and weaknesses of various types of cameras and explains why the biggest or most expensive piece of equipment is not always the best. He also addresses the importance of lighting and teaches you how to achieve effective lighting without spending a lot of money. <br><br>Also included are discussions about aesthetics and composition, as well as a brief history of photography and the future of the art form.</p></p><p><p>Steve Johnson was originally a painter who took photographs. Over the last decade he has become a photographer who paints occasionally. His distinctive minimal style stems from the belief that subject matter is not as important as aesthetic considerations like composition, tone, and line. <br><br>Steve has taught visual art and undertaken commercial art projects on both sides of the Atlantic and in the Middle East. He and his wife also owned a gallery that specialized in both painting and photography.<br><br>Steve's work has been exhibited in both the United States and the United Kingdom. He is a UK citizen who lives and works in the American Midwest.</p><p> "Who is this book for? This is yet another excellent read for aspiring photographers. Breaking down the many overwhelming aspects and complications of photography, this book manages to focus on what is most relevant in true photographic creation. The Minimalist Photographer touches on all of the key components of authentic photography in an easy to digest and extremely helpful manner." -- Photo.net</p></p><h2>The American Railroad Freight Car: From the Wood-Car Era to the Coming of Steel</h2><p><p>� From the former Curator of Transportation at the Smithsonian Institution � Illustrated with 530 photographs, drawings, and engravings � Includes plans, diagrams, and detailed specifications for model-builders � 665 oversized pages in a handsomely jacketed hardcover or specially priced paperback editionIn this sequel to his best-selling <i>American Railroad Passenger Car</i>, John White forever changes the freight car's lowly image.

Have you tried everything? Are you plagued by stubborn fat hanging around your hips, thighs, and belly? Well, there's a reason for that. All those frustratingly pointless diets and exercise regimes have failed to address the root cause of weight gain.</p><p>According to Dr. Lori Shemek, a successful diet isn't centered on calories or cardio. She says, "Cutting calories doesn't cut it." Our problems with fat are created because we eat foods that cause the body's natural fat cells to become inflamed. Sadly, the staples of the Standard American Diet&#x2014;from pasta and bread to factory-farmed chicken and cattle, from sugar and artificial sweeteners to salad dressing and soft drinks&#x2014;irritate our fat cells, causing chronic inflammation and chronically oversized fat cells. This irritation causes the body to store fat permanently, no matter how hard you exercise or how diligently you cut back on calories.</p><p>Dr. Shemek calls this serious condition <em>FATflammation</em>, and only when you decrease the inflammation of the fat cells can you achieve the weight loss and optimum health you've been chasing. We need to forget about counting calories, counting points, fad diets, no-fat diets, and spending countless hours at the gym. There is a better and more satisfying way to lose the fat and maintain your desired weight. "If we want to fix our problems with fat," Shemek writes, "we need to reduce the inflammation in our fat cells." In <em>How to Fight FATflammation</em> Shemek reveals her revolutionary three-week program that helps reboot your body chemistry by returning your body's fat cells back to their natural, healthy state. In the process, she explains the critical importance of maintaining balance between good fats (omega-3) and bad fats (omega-6) and how a proper ratio of both will help boost your metabolism; in short, your body will burn fat simply by your eating the right kinds of fat. She also helps you eliminate from your diet the dreaded FATflammation Four&#x2014;sugar, refined grains, high-fructose corn syrup, and artificial sweeteners. Here's your chance to shrink your fat cells and get the body you always wanted.</p></p><p><p>Lori Shemek, Ph.D., is a leading researcher in fat cells and the owner of DLS Healthworks.

On the prairie, along the Osage Trail that travelers take from northeast to central south in their new state, the family builds a combination dwelling, inn, and grocery. It's just a small frame house really, with family quarters curtained off from the larger area of the building where the public stops in for provisions, a meal, or perhaps a night's rest. There's a basement underneath, with a large, flat stone serving as its floor. Travelers in the vicinity are disappearing, but for a long time no one realizes it.

In the summer of 1701, 1,300 representatives of forty First Nations from the Maritimes to the Great Lakes and from James Bay to southern Illinois met with the French at Montreal. Elaborate, month-long ceremonies culminated in the signing of The Great Peace of Montreal, which effectively put an end to the Iroquois wars. In The Great Peace of Montreal of 1701 Gilles Havard brings to life the European and Native players who brought about this major feat of international diplomacy. He highlights the differing interests and strategies of the numerous First Nations involved while giving a dramatic account of the colourful conference. The treaty, Havard argues, was the culmination of the French colonial strategy of Native alliances and adaptation to Native political customs. It illustrates the extent of cultural interchange between the French and their Native allies and the crucial role the latter played in French conflicts with the Iroquois and the British. As we approach the 300th anniversary of the treaty&#39;s signing in August 1701, Gilles Havard emphasizes its contemporary significance: in signing a treaty with forty separate parties the French recognized the independent sovereignty of every First Nation. This translation is significantly revised and updated from the original French publication of 1992.</p><p>Havard is a historian living in Paris.<br><br>Phyllis Aronoff and Howard Scott live and translate in Montreal, Quebec. Howard Scott received the 1997 Governor General's Literary Award for his translation of The Euguelion.&#34;Gilles Havard&#39;s book is a first rate study of the factors that led to the Montreal Peace of 1701, and of the agreement itself.

Dr. Pellegrino lives in New York.This is a readable, colorful book that should be approached with caution. The authors put Grumman Corporation, prime contractor for the lunar module, in center stage. While contractors often get less credit than they deserve, the emphasis here results in an unbalanced view. The resolution of major issues generally was much more complex than the narrative suggests. One might infer from the text that a Grumman executive singlehandedly convinced the White House to implement the Space Station program. Finally, the authors have re-created some of the correspondence and dialogue, a technique which is not always successful. Which parts are historically accurate and which are not? In spite of dramatic writing, use of historically significant material, and a number of interesting illustrations, this, by its nature, appears to be a rather subjective account. Roger E.

With objectivity and accessibility, this title in the Kids Book of series looks at the histories, scriptures, places of worship, religious leaders, gods and major festivals that are the foundations of many of the world&#39;s religions. Features a glossary and an index.</p><p>John Mantha is an artist and illustrator. His books include The Kids Book of Canadian Firsts and The Kids Book of Canada&#39;s Railway. He lives in Toronto, Ontario.Grade 3-6-Glossop devotes one to four spreads to Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Readers learn of the basic teachings and beliefs, scriptures, religious leaders, sacred places, and sacred events involved in each faith and a quick-fact box outlines the statistics and major tenets. However, the single-page sections covering indigenous religions from Africa, North America, and Australia are less useful because of their brevity. Illustrations meld effectively with narrative; Mantha's bright watercolors picture symbols, gods, and rituals, artistically drawing readers from point to point. A few well-placed photographs add to the text: sacred places such as the Lingaraj temple in India, an ancient mosque in Cordoba, and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and sacred objects such as a reclining Buddha in Thailand, a Muslim mihrab (prayer alcove), and an Australian Aboriginal painting. For a more concise and clear explanation of basic religious beliefs, see Mary Pope Osborne's One World, Many Religions (Knopf, 1996), and for a basic explanation of the history of religion, refer to Betsy Maestro's The Story of Religion (Clarion, 1993) or Myrtle Langley's Religion (Knopf, 1996).

P.</p><p></p><h2>Selected Letters</h2><p>CLAUDE DEBUSSY was one of the most influential and enigmatic composers of our century. It seems extraordinary that until now there has been no representative collection of his correspondence published in English. A brilliant stylist, Debussy is witty, caustic and prodigal with vivid turns of phrase. His letters to more than 70 correspondents are rich in uninhibited remarks about his own music and about fellow musicians: Berlioz, &#39;a prodigious humbug&#39;; Bizet, &#39;the Maupassant of music&#39;; Faur�, &#39;the standard-bearer for a group of snobs and imbeciles&#39;; Richard Strauss, &#39;the symphonic domestic&#39;; d&#39;Indy, &#39;the Schola contractor&#39;; Ravel, the &#39;fakir-cum-enchanter&#39;. His circle included painters and many leading symbolist writers, Andr� Gide, Mallarm�, and Pierre LouYs prominent among them. Throughout his correspondence, Debussy has important things to say about central issues in art, literature, theatre, and music in the period leading up to the First World War when the foundations of modernism were laid. To the 255 letters in the original French edition have been added a further 56, several of which have never been published in French. Roger Nichols&#39;s translation perfectly captures Debussy&#39;s verbal chemistry which often reveals depths of sadness and frustration counterbalancing the marvellous flights of fancy. A vivid picture emerges of the struggles, hopes and fears of this wayward and elusive genius. Francois Lesure is an internationally respected scholar and head of the music section of the Biblioth�que nationale in Paris. Roger Nichols is a well-known authority on French music, whose previous books include studies of Ravel and Messiaen.</p><p></p><h2>The New York Times Will Shortz&#39;s Greatest Hits: 150 Crossword Puzzles Personally Picked by the Puzzlemaster</h2><p><p>Will Shortz is a legendary figure in American crosswords--the one name even casual solvers recognize.

Its activities transcend national and international borders. Its activities are not unduly constrained by financial, political, cultural, ethnic, or religious concerns. The net of this is that business, as a prevalent and important force, has a moral responsibility to guide, enhance, value, and nourish the existence of all that it encounters. In the world today, the absolute opposite of this occurs. Business today seldom assesses the efficacy of its activities through the lens of anything but profit. Traditional capitalism forgets an important variable, that of happiness. The true purpose of business is to uplift the experience of existing. It is not to make owners wealthy. It is not to produce ever-cheaper goods and services. Compassionate capitalism is an economic system meant to make a lot of money, help a lot of people, and have a lot of fun. It is not to keep an avaricious and toxic economic model afloat. And it is certainly not (with no apology to Milton Friedman) to make a profit. &#34;</p><p>Blaine Bartlett is a thought leader, author, professor, and keynote speaker.

As work on the first atomic bomb nears completion in New Mexico, Karl Bruner, a Manhattan Project security officer, is found murdered.</p><p>Michael Connolly, the intelligence officer brought in to crack Bruner's case, soon discovers that investigating a murder in Los Alamos - a town so secret it does not officially exist - is anything but easy. Only once he falls in love and begins an affair with Emma, the enigmatic wife of one of the scientists, does he truly begin to unravel the dark heart of the Project.</p><p>Interweaving fact and fiction, <i>Los Alamos</i> is at once a powerful novel of historical intrigue and a vivid portrait of the most mysterious figures involved in the Manhattan Project: Robert Oppenheimer.</p><p>'Accomplished and beautifully written'<br><i>Sunday Telegraph</i></p><p>'Enthralling . . . a dream of a novel'<br><i>Time Out</i></p></p><p>A successful thriller tells an exciting, satisfying story and lets us look at the lives of some interesting people in an environment either totally new or freshly observed. Former publishing executive Joseph Kanon's first novel does all of that, and adds a layer of acute perception about recent history that immediately vaults it up into the hallowed heights of John Le Carre's <i>Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy</i> and Charles McCarry's <i>The Tears of Autumn</i>--thrillers that deserve space next to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. In the spring of 1945, as the war in Europe is coming to an end, a former police reporter turned Army Intelligence agent named Mike Connolly arrives on the high mesa above Santa Fe, New Mexico, where J. Robert Oppenheimer and a team of scientists are rushing to finish their atomic bomb. A security man has been found battered to death, and Connolly's job is to see if it is anything more than the sordid sex crime it appears to be. Using a devilishly clever mixture of real and fictional characters, Kanon spins out a story that manages to be audacious, persuasive--and totally engrossing.<p>"They tell me Joseph Kanon is a publishing executive, but I don't believe it. I think he is a veteran of the 1945 atom bomb program. No one could write a first novel so convincing as <i>Los Alamos</i> without having been there. No one could conjure the wartime background with such subtle restraint. If I'm wrong, Joseph Kanon is an outstanding new writer, and <i>Los Alamos</i> is a triumph of historical re-creation and my sort of story-telling." <br>--Len Deighton</p><p>"Joseph Kanon's <i>Los Alamos</i> is a thoroughly absorbing novel set in the midst of what we now know as both the most exciting scientific saga of our century and the invention with the greatest potential for tragedy that our civilization has yet produced. What begins as the pursuit of a murderer through the landscape of a wartime Southwest quickly descends into a deeper mystery involving eminent scientists, Robert Oppenheimer among them, and the cold calculations of military intelligence. Knowing the aftermath of what happened at Los Alamos, as we do, only deepens the experience of this finely crafted book."<br>--Stuart Woods, author of <i>Dead in the Water </i>and<i> Dirt</i></p><p>"There really were heroes, spies, and lovers at Los Alamos in the days when they built the first atomic bombs, and in this compelling novel Joe Kanon has imagined those soaring, harrowing days back to life.

The title of this classic comes from William Blakes the Marriage of Heaven and Hell: If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern.</p><p>Sometimes a writer has to revisit the classics, and here we find that &#34;gonzo journalism&#34;--gutsy first-person accounts wherein the author is part of the story--didn&#39;t originate with Hunter S. Thompson or Tom Wolfe. Aldous Huxley took some mescaline and wrote about it some 10 or 12 years earlier than those others. The book he came up with is part bemused essay and part mystical treatise--&#34;suchness&#34; is everywhere to be found while under the influence. This is a good example of essay writing, journal keeping, and the value of controversy--always--in one&#39;s work.In 1953, Aldous Huxley took four-tenths of a gram of the drug Mescalin, sat down and waited to see what would happen. When he opened his eyes everything was transformed. He describes his experience in The Doors of Perception and its sequel Heaven and Hell.</p><h2>Potato Cookbook</h2><p>Book by Walden, Hilaire</p><p></p><h2>Sunset Terrace: A Novel</h2><p>During the summer of 1983, Elaine and her daughters Hannah and Daisy move into Sunset Terrace, a squalid, low-rent apartment building in Los Angeles that houses single mothers.

Now living with a foster family, Bridget quickly becomes Hannah's best friend, teaching her how to climb a chain-link fence and steal candy. </p><p>As the summer wears on, Elaine becomes captivated by Bridget as well, encouraging her to come over for dinner and sleepovers, taking on the role of a surrogate mother. Compelled by pity for the wayward girl, Elaine is blind to Bridget's dangerous influence on Hannah, who at the summer's end takes part in a malicious game that irrevocably alters the course of all of their lives.</p></p><p>"Donner's writing is nothing short of gorgeous....This is a remarkable debut." - Baltimore Sun <p>"Donner's finely observed portraits of the Sunset Terrace denizens...show a rare gift, perfectly capturing both the era and milieu." - Publishers Weekly </p><p>"Rebecca Donner has captured with painful accuracy the way that longing and love between girls can get tangled until it becomes an impossible knot.

Twelve kaleidoscopic tableaux, accompanied by a straightforward, easy-to-understand narrative, portray the Old Testament story of creation &#x2014; seven momentous days in which God creates the world: light and dark, sky and earth, fishes, birds, animals and finally man and woman. French returns to perhaps the most compelling text of the many available &#x2014; the Authorized King James version of the Bible &#x2014; to bring the Book of Genesis in all of its timeless drama into glowing perspective for young readers.</p><p>Fiona French studied Art Education at Croydon College of Art and went on to work as Bridget Riley&#39;s assistant. In 1986 she won the Kate Greenaway Medal for Snow White in New York. In 1992 her first book for Frances Lincoln, Anancy and Mr Dry-Bone was shortlisted for the Kate Greenaway Medal and chosen as a Children&#39;s Book of the Year. Pepi and the Secret Names (written by Jill Paton Walsh), was one of Child Education&#39;s Best Story Books of 1994 and shortlisted for the 1995 Children&#39;s Book Award. She is renowned for her distinctively sharp and colourful illustrations. Her other books for Frances Lincoln are Paradise, Bethlehem, Easter and Canticle of the Sun; The Smallest Samurai, Glass Garden, Jamil&#39;s Clever Cat, Lord of the Animals and Pepi and the Secret Names.Grade 2-5&#x2013;French conveys the story of Creation through stunning illustrations. Excerpted from the King James translation of the Bible, the text describes how God created the universe, the world, and all its creatures, and also relates the story of the Garden of Eden. The narrative contains some difficult language, but the vibrant paintings, resembling panels of stained glass, illuminate the tale. The colors are deliberate and bold. God appears as an eye in the sky overlooking Paradise. The swirling black lines used to depict the formation of "the heaven and the earth" gradually settle down, gracefully forming the outline shapes of a whale, a giraffe, and other creatures. There is much to see in these detailed yet elegant pictures, and readers will discover new images upon each viewing. Youngsters already familiar with the Creation story will most enjoy this brilliantly illustrated rendition.<i>&#x2013;Jodi Kearns, University of Akron, OH</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Throughout history Indian culture has been subject to myriad different influences, from the Mughal empire to the British Raj to the now globalized nation in transition. Similar to 'Wa: Essence of Japanese Design', this book will trace continuity through the history of Indian design from antiquity to the present day.</p><p>The book explores the elements that make Indian design so special, including the varied manufacturing and decorating techniques of the country&#x2019;s incredibly skilled craftsmen, highly specialized object designs that have been refined over centuries, and ongoing responses to nature, technology, and necessity. The objects were chosen for their enduring quality and beauty, and their integral connection to Indian culture.</p><p>Rather than following a chronological order or concentrating on the (often anonymous) designers, this book separates the objects into abstract categories anchored by Hindi words chosen to illuminate how each object fits into the lives of Indians.</p></p><p><p>Swapnaa Tamhane (b. 1976) is an artist and curator, based in Mumbai and Toronto.

Can you name a few of your favorite literary love stories?<br> <b>Maeve Binchy:</b> I think most people read a love story long before they ever know what true love is like. So we remember the great passions that we read about when we were young. I loved the story of Anthony and Cleopatra, and how Anthony allowed himself to dally with the Queen of Egypt when he should have been back in Rome watching his back. I liked the frenetic, troubled romances in F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the changing patterns of Scarlett O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s love life in <i>Gone with the Wind</i>. <br> <p><b>Q:</b> <i>Heart and Soul</i> is set in a heart clinic. Why did you choose this setting and how does it influence the story?<br> <b>MB:</b> I set <i>Heart and Soul</i> in a heart clinic because I attend one myself. I have always found it a place of hope and optimism where they teach you how to manage your heart disease and not to be afraid of it. When I was young if anyone had a heart attack we thought it was goodbye. But not nowadays.</p> <p>It seemed like a good place to set a story, a place where people were slowly getting courage to live their lives to the fullest. And I wanted to make it cheerful and positive and funny, which is what we all need. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> The book centers on Clara, the doctor in charge of the clinic, but the book also follows quite an ensemble of characters with intertwining stories. How does your work within the discipline of short story writing contribute to your work within the novel genre?<br> <b>MB:</b> I like to concentrate on the bit part players, the supporting cast as well as the main characters, so it&#x2019;s often interesting to pause and follow somebody home to a different life while still connecting them to the main story. Then when that person appears again it is like meeting an old friend.</p> <p>Because I do write short stories I suppose I find it easy to slip into someone&#x2019;s life for a short time and then leave.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> New characters are joined by a few from past books, including Nora from <i>Evening Class</i>, Maud and Simon from <i>Scarlet Feather</i>, and Quentins itself (if I can call a restaurant a character). How did you decide which characters to bring back to life?<br> <b>MB:</b> I decided to bring back characters whose lives were not finished and tidied up. I was even wondering myself would Vonni ever find her long lost son? Would Signora be happy when she married Aidan? How the twins Maud and Simon would turn out when they stopped being twelve year olds. I wondered would poor Father Flynn, who was so basically decent, survive in the parish where they were all obsessed with the Holy Well or would he get a more relevant posting. I so enjoyed meeting them all again and I think the readers like it too.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Irish culture is known for its storytelling, both in the oral and written tradition. Do you also enjoy telling stories out loud? Are you the life of the dinner party?<br> <b>MB:</b> The Irish do love telling stories and we are suspicious of people who don&#x2019;t have long complicated conversations. There used to be a rule in Etiquette Books that you invited four talkers and four listeners to a dinner party. That doesn&#x2019;t work in Ireland because nobody knows four listeners. I do talk a lot at dinner parties--I hope not too much but then I love other people to talk also. I am edgy and anxious when people just nod and smile instead of having views on every subject under the sun.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your books capture the culture of Ireland. Although Ireland has not escaped the recent economic downturn, how has Ireland&#x2019;s rapid growth--finally joining the ranks of the world&#x2019;s wealthiest countries following centuries of poverty--influenced your storytelling?<br> <b>MB:</b> Ireland changed a great deal in my lifetime. People became much more wealthy because of being members of the European community. The influence of the Catholic Church changed--once we feared the clergy and were in awe of them and now it is much easier and more communal. Once no foreigners came to work here since there wasn&#x2019;t enough work for ourselves, but now it&#x2019;s multicultural and you could hear twenty languages being spoken all around you. It has been a great help to the country and given us all more confidence.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Your first book was published in 1982. Has your writing process changed over the years? How do you continue to challenge yourself?<br> <b>MB:</b> When I started writing I used to concentrate on the 50s and 60s when I was young, but I needed to try to become more modern and catch up on today&#x2019;s Ireland. So I started to watch the young Irish people and talk to them as if they were a different tribe, which in many ways they are!</p> <p>I discovered that they are not so different to my generation, they have more freedom, more responsibility and more courage than we had but they also have areas of uncertainty and unrequited love as we all did.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What are you working on next?<br> <b>MB:</b> I am working at the moment on writing a three page outline for another novel. I must make it interesting enough for the publishers to like it and give me the go ahead. It should be in the same style as the books I have already written but not visit the same topics and repeat myself.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Describe a typical day spent writing. Do you have any unusual writing habits?<br> <b>MB:</b> A typical day is breakfast (grapefruit and Irish soda bread and tea), then on to a big bright work room upstairs. [My husband and I] both try to be at our desks there at 8:30 am and we work until 1 pm. This includes answering mail and filing. We have a secretary one day a week. Then when work is over we have lunch and play a game of chess--we play seven days a week and have been doing so for over thirty years and we are still hopeless at it but love it to bits.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> With two writers in one household, do you and your husband give each other feedback or work separately?<br> <b>MB:</b> We have one long desk in our study upstairs--Gordon [Snell] is at one end and I am at the other. He writes his children&#x2019;s books and verses and I do my stories. We always read each other our work in the afternoon. The rules are that we must be honest. No false praise. We allow the other ten minutes sulking time if we don&#x2019;t like what we&#x2019;ve heard. But then we have to accept or reject the criticism. No one is allowed to brood over it!</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What are you reading now? What are some of your favorite books and authors?<br> <b>MB:</b> I have just begun <i>Revolutionary Road</i> by Richard Yates, which seems terrific. There are so many but off the top of my head here are some names of authors I love: Anne Tyler, Harlan Coben, Lee Child, and David Baldacci.</p> <p> (Photo � David Timmons) </p><b>MAEVE BINCHY</b>&nbsp;was born in County Dublin and educated at the Holy Child convent in Killiney and at University College, Dublin.

Harry</b> is an American novelist and lawyer. A graduate of Vanderbilt University (with a BA, an MBA, and a JD), Harry is the author of four novels.Harry's first novel is all gloom and doom, an appropriate tone for his World War III scenario. When US President Livingston receives a tip that Russia will bomb China, he informs the Chinese, who then bomb Moscow, where General Zorin, a zealous patriot, has temporarily overthrown the government. Believing the attack to be a US initiative, Zorin launches a counterstrike against US military bases. In the tense moments before the missiles strike, Livingston gives in to military pressure and retaliates, fueling a war featuring biological, chemical, and possibly nuclear weapons. Zorin's coup is ended by the Russians, but his firing plan remains in effect: If provoked, nuclear submarines will fire upon 304 American cities. Livingston, whose decency and common sense have become political liabilities, is impeached and succeeded by his ``California Enviroweenie'' veep, who has become an opportunistic warmonger. Livingston's last supporter among the White House staff is Greg Lambert, the bright young national security advisor who may be able to negotiate with the few peace-seeking Russian statesmen. The bloody, conventional land battles feature David Chandler, the weekend reservist who leads an armored battalion in an invasion of Moscow in his first combat experience; and Marine Lance Corporal Terrence Monk, whose squadron faces an opposed landing on the eastern Russian shore. Descriptions of the physiological responses to nuclear and chemical warfare are jarring, but the secondary effects are surprising, too. After nuclear devastation in some US locations, the government contends with an economic depression caused by fearful workers who have fled the cities and sit glued to CNN and the Weather Channel. A grim tale which so successfully evokes the bleakness and terror of an impending world war that it could depress contemplative readers while titillating those just out for techno- thrills. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Chris Raschka answers loudly and clearly with the illustrated, syncopated <i>Charlie Parker Played Be Bop</i>. This sparse, rhythmic, repetitive text (inspired by a recording of Parker's "A Night in Tunisia") embraces and reflects the sound and feel of jazz when read aloud: "Charlie Parker played be bop. / Charlie Parker played saxophone. / The music sounded like be bop. / Never leave your cat alone." Whether in complete phrases or in nonsense refrains that taste like music in your mouth ("Alphabet alphabet, alphabet, alph, / Chickadee, chickadee, chickadee, chick, / Overshoes, overshoes, overshoes, o, / Reeti-footi, reeti-footi, reeti-footi, ree."), Raschka brings melody to the page, and rhythm to eager ears.<p> Raschka, whose <i>Yo!

Patches of rust have broken out along the letters like a skin rash and the pounding of sea storms and winter winds have bent the gates back. Now they lean against the somber gray skies and the great house itself looks oppressed, weighed down by time and the heavy and bleak history that lives in its hallways and grand rooms. There are a few employees kept on to look after the house and grounds, but no one really checks on their work and they do relatively little to keep things up.<br><br>Luke squeezes my hand. It has been years, centuries, it seems, since we have been here. The dismal skies are appropriate for our arrival, for this is not a nostalgic journey. We would rather not remember my stay here, my imprisonment I should say, after the dreadful accident that took my parents' lives.<br><br>But our journey is sadder yet. The funeral air is correct. We have come to bury my real father, to put Troy Tatterton finally to rest alongside his true love, my mother, Heaven.<br>He had remained in his little cottage all these years, continuing his intricate artistic work on the wonderful Tatterton Toys, leaving only for special occasions like the births of my children. But whenever he visited us, no matter what the occasion, he could never stay away from Farthinggale long. Something always called him back.<br><br>Now he will never leave.<br><br>Even though the great house looms forever in my nightmares, and the memories of those tortured days remain remarkably vivid still, once I took upon this grand estate, I understand why Troy had the need to return. Even I, who have every reason not to, feel a need to reenter the house and walk through its long corridors, up its great stairway to view the room that had been my cell.<br><br>Luke doesn't want me to go inside.<br><br>"Annie," he says, "it's not necessary. We'll wait for the burial ceremony to start and greet whoever there is to greet outside."<br><br>But I can't help myself. Something draws me on.<br><br>I don't enter what was my bedroom. There are cobwebs everywhere and everywhere there is dust and grime. Curtains are faded and hang loose. Linens look stained, dirty.<br><br>I shake my head and walk on, pausing at Jillian's suite, the famous suite Tony had kept up with a fanatical urgency, refusing to face up to Jillian's passing and all that had gone with it. The suite has always intrigued me. It intrigues me now. I walk in, look up at the mirrors without their glass, gaze at the clothing still draped over chairs, the toiletries still on the vanity table. I pass it all, slowly, moving like one through a dream, the air like gauze.<br><br>And then I stop at Jillian's desk. I do not know why I do, but perhaps it's because the drawer is slightly open. Everything about this suite intrigues me and I wonder if there is something in that drawer that Jillian might have written during her days of madness.<br><br>Curiosity takes hold of me and I open the drawer. I blow away the dust and peer inside to see blank paper, pens and ink. Nothing unusual I think and then I spot the cloth bag toward the rear of the drawer and reach in.<br><br>There's a book in it. I take it out slowly.<br><br>LEIGH'S BOOK, it says on the front. I hold my breath. It is my grandmother's diary. I open to the first page and find myself falling back through time.<br><br><b>Chapter 1: Leigh's Book of Memories</b><br><br>I think it first started with a dream. No, not a dream, but more of a nightmare. In it I was standing with my parents -- I don't know where. They were talking with each other and sometimes they would turn and say something to me. The only thing was, whenever I tried to talk to them, they seemed unable to hear me. As I kept trying to get into their conversation I reached up to push my hair back. Yet instead of my hair falling into place, I was horrified to discover a large clump of hair falling into my hand. Again and again I pushed back at my hair and each time I did another clump of my hair came free. I stared, horrified, at the large strands of hair in my hand. What was going on? Suddenly, a mirror appeared before me and in it I could see my image. I choked back a scream. My beautiful cashmere sweater was filled with holes and my skirt was torn and dirty. Then, before my already disbelieving eyes, I watched my features bloat. As I became fatter and fatter I started to cry. A trail of tears streamed down my smudged cheeks. I tore my eyes from my ugly image and turned to my parents, screaming for their help. My screams reverberated and bounced off the walls. Yet my parents did nothing. Why wouldn't they help me?<br><br>I couldn't stop screaming. Finally, when I thought my voice was gone and I was unable to utter a sound, they turned to me. Looks of astonishment broke across their faces. I wanted to call to Daddy...to have him cover me with hugs and kisses...to protect me as he always had...but before I could open my mouth, a look of disgust came over his face! I cringed in horror and then he disappeared. Only Momma remained. At least, I thought it was Momma. This stranger looked exactly like her...except for her eyes. Her eyes were so cold! Cold and calculating...empty of the love and warmth I saw daily. Where had it gone? Why was she looking at me this way? My beautiful momma would never look at me with such hatred. Yes, hatred...and jealousy! My momma wouldn't fail to help me in my most desperate moment. Yet she did nothing. First, a look of disgust, identical to the look Daddy had given me, appeared. Soon it was replaced by a smirk...a smirk of satisfaction. And then she turned her back on me...starting to walk away...leaving...leaving me alone in the darkness.<br><br>Somehow I found my voice and cried for her help. But she only kept walking, becoming smaller and smaller. I tried to follow, but was unable to move. Then I turned back to my image and before I could blink an eye, the mirror shattered and shards of glass came directly at my face.<br><br>With my last bit of strength I screamed, raising my hands to shield my face as I kept screaming and screaming.<br><br>When I awoke I was still screaming and my heart was beating furiously. For a moment I couldn't figure out where I was. Then, as the familiar surroundings of my bedroom came into view, I remembered. I was home in my bedroom in Boston. Today was my birthday. My twelfth birthday. Glad to be out of my awful dream, I put my fears behind me and pushed away the images that had terrified me only seconds ago. I headed downstairs with only thoughts of the day ahead.<br><br>On my twelfth birthday, I opened what would be my most precious gift: this book for memories. At the last moment, Daddy slipped it into the small mountain of wonderful and expensive gifts he and Momma had bought me. I knew he had put it there himself after Momma had arranged everything because she was just as curious about it as I was. Daddy usually left the buying of gifts completely in Momma's hands, just as he left her in charge of buying things for the house and buying all my clothes because he admittedly knew absolutely nothing when it came to fashions. He said Momma was an artist, so she would know better about color coordinations and designs, but I think he was just happy not to have to go to department stores and clothing stores.<br><br>On a few occasions when I was younger, Daddy brought me models of his steamships, but Momma thought those were silly gifts for a little girl, especially the one that you took apart to learn about the workings of the engine. But I couldn't help being intrigued and very interested and played with it all the time, except when Momma was around.<br><br>Everything was stacked on one side of the dining room table at breakfast, just as it always had been on every birthday I could remember. I had woken early, of course, because of the dream. Birthday mornings were usually like Christmas mornings to me, although this morning I was still a little upset by the nightmare, and now I tried hard to forget its scariness.<br><br>Daddy had the surprise gift wrapped in light pink paper with birthday candles painted in dark blue that spelled out HAPPY BIRTHDAY all over it. Just knowing he had bought it for me all by himself made it the most important gift there. I tried not to rip the paper as I unwrapped it. I loved saving things like that, mementos of all my special occasions: the candles from my tenth birthday cake, the one that was so big it took both Clarence the butler and Svenson the cook to carry it into the dining room; the candy angel on the top of the four-foot Christmas tree Momma bought to have placed in my playroom when I was only five; tickets from the circus Daddy took me to when it came to Boston last year, a play program from the Punch and Judy puppet show at the museum Momma and I went to when I was seven, and dozens of odds and ends like buttons and pins and even old shoe laces. So Daddy already knew that memories were precious to me.<br><br>I took the book out slowly and ran the tips of my fingers over the cover, over my name. I just loved the feel of the buttersoft, rose-colored leather cover with the gilded edging, and I especially loved seeing my name in print written like the title of a book: LEIGH'S BOOK.<br><br>I looked up with excitement. Daddy, already dressed in his dark gray three-piece suit and tie, stood back smiling, standing there the way he usually stood with his hands clasped behind his back, rocking on his heels like an old sea captain. Usually, Momma made him stop, claiming it made her nervous. Because Daddy was the owner of a big luxury ocean liner company and was on one ship or another so often, he said he spent more time on the water than on the land and he was used to rocking.<br><br>"What is that?" Momma asked when I opened the cover to blank page after blank page.<br><br>"I call it a logbook," Daddy said and winked at me. "Captain's log. Keep track of the major events. Memories are more precious than jewels," Daddy said.<br><br>"It's just a diary," Momma said shaking her head. "Logbook. She's a little girl, not a sailor."<br><br>Daddy winked at me again. Momma had bought me so many very expensive things, I knew I should pay more attention to them, but I clutched the book called LEIGH'S BOOK to my heart and got up quickly to kiss Daddy thank you. He knelt down and I kissed him on his rosy cheek just above his gray beard, and his shimmering rust-brown eyes brightened. Momma claimed Daddy was on one or another of his ships or at the ocean so much, his skin tasted salty, but I never tasted it whenever I kissed him.<br><br>"Thank you, Daddy," I whispered. "I'll write about you all the time."<br><br>There were so many things to write down, so many private and precious thoughts, I couldn't wait to do it. But Momma was anxious for me to unwrap the other gifts. There were a dozen cashmere sweaters in a variety of pinks and blues and greens, each with a matching pencilslim skirt, the skirt Momma said everyone was wearing even though they were so narrow you couldn't walk very quickly in them. There were silk blouses and gold hoop earrings and a matching bracelet splattered with diamond flecks from Tiffany's. There was Chanel perfume and scented soaps, as well as a pearl comb and brush set.<br><br>And lipstick! I was finally going to be able to wear it, lightly of course, and only on special occasions. But I had my very own. Momma always promised she would show me how to wear makeup correctly when the time came.<br><br>There was one package she said I couldn't open now. It had to wait until we were alone, later.<br><br>"Girl business," she said eyeing my father. She thought it was horrible of him to rush off to his office on my birthday morning, but he said he could spend the rest of the day with me and then take Momma and me to dinner, so I forgave him. There was always one sort of crisis or another for him these days. He blamed it on commercial jet airline travel that was increasingly cutting into the luxury ocean liner business. Momma always criticized him for how much time he spent working, and this all made it worse.<br><br>Although we had gone on many trips, she claimed we were like shoemakers without shoes because we didn't go on the trips she wanted.<br><br>"My husband's in the vacation travel business and we rarely vacation. We have to check out new routes or new ships, rather than enjoy the way we should," she complained, sometimes bitterly.<br><br>I knew my last big package had something to do with all this because she said she bought what was in it, hoping I would have an opportunity to use it, and then she scowled at Daddy and said, "I still haven't had an opportunity to use mine."<br><br>I tore open the package quickly and opened the box. It was a skiing outfit: a heavy cashmere sweater and tailored ski trousers with a matching Italian silk blouse. Many times during the summer, Momma had voiced her desire to go for a winter holiday to St. Moritz and stay at the Palace Hotel, "where all the best of society stopped." It was a beautiful outfit.<br><br>I looked over all my wonderful presents, squealed with delight and hugged her. She vowed she was always going to make sure I would have better birthdays than she had when she was growing up in Texas. Even though her family wasn't poor, she said her mother, my grandma Jana, was as austere as a Puritan minister. She had told me over and over the sad story of how she wasn't even allowed to have a doll when she was a little girl, and she said her sisters, both older, were just like her mother because they were both so plain looking, they didn't care about being feminine and having dainty and beautiful things.<br><br>Aunt Peggy and Aunt Beatrice really were as ugly as the wicked witch in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> We didn't see them very often, but whenever we did, I hated the way they gaped at me through their thick-rimmed spectacles. Both wore the same ugly black-frame glasses that magnified their dull brown eyes, making them look like frogs. The way Momma always clumped them together when she spoke about them made me think of them as twins. They did have identical shapes. "Ironing boards," Momma called them. She said Grandma Jana found them husbands, spineless homely men themselves: one the owner of a department store in Ludville, Texas, and the other an undertaker in nearby Fairfax.<br><br>According to Momma, both Texas towns as well as her own "were so dusty and dirty, you had to take a bath after a walk through Main Street." It didn't take Daddy long to win Momma away from all that. I made her tell me the story again and again, never minding that each time she told it, she added something new or changed or forgot something she had told me before. The main part of the story was always the same and it was one of the first things I wanted to put into my book.<br><br>So in the early evening, when she came into my room to talk while we both got ready to go out to a fancy Boston restaurant for my birthday dinner, I asked her to tell me the story again.<br><br>"Don't you ever get tired of hearing about that?" she asked, throwing me a quick look.<br><br>"Oh no, Momma. I think it's a wonderful story, a dream story. No one could ever write one as beautiful," I said, which made her very happy.<br><br>"All right," she said, sitting down at my vanity table. She began to brush her beautiful hair, till it shone like spun gold. "I lived like poor Cinderella did before her prince arrived," she began as always. "But it wasn't always like that. I was the apple of my father's eye. He was a foreman in charge of everything at a nearby oil field, a very important man. Although he wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty when he had to, he was a very elegant man. I hope some day you'll find a man like my father."<br><br>"Isn't Daddy like him then? He doesn't ...</p><h2>A Child&#39;s First Catholic Dictionary</h2><p>Concisely defines terms which deal with aspects of the faith, worship, ethics, history, theology, and spirituality of the Catholic Church</p><p>Richard W.

Her book is truly a reflection of her bicoastal (New York&#x2013;California) life: specifically, how to dress and act and behave in this era of everyday glamour, which simply means knowing yourself, your comfort level, and what&#x2019;s the best visual interpretation of you in fashion. In addition to some solid tips (Who knew that it takes 12 hours to thoroughly dry nail polish?), Zoe imparts almost TMI about her personal life and habits: her favorite hotels, iconic inspirations, travel recommendations, even an hour-by-hour day in her life. Beauty tips coexist with some intriguing expert commentary on collecting art, buying vintage stuff (primarily clothing and accessories), and making memorable toasts, among other topics. Pictures and contributors from the fashionable crowd (think both living and deceased, such as Brigitte Bardot, Jackie Onassis, the Rodarte sisters, Farah Fawcett, and others) could make this a go-to keepsake for the young and impressionable. --Barbara Jacobs</p><h2>My Secret History</h2><p>&#39;Nothing on the shelf has quite prepared the reader for &#34;My Secret History&#34; ...Parent saunters into the book aged fifteen, shouldering a .22 Mossberg rifle as earlier, more innocent American heroes used to tote a fishing pole.

From a psychiatrist-author one might expect subtle analysis of character and motivation, and this is certainly what Wheelis provides. His purpose is to examine different varieties of love and to study the cycle in which frustrated desire turns to despair and despair fans more intense desire. Such analysis is incisive, but some readers may find the plot too sparse. In fact, Wheelis divides his novel into two distinct sections"Story" and "Meditation." He suggests that readers who want to think for themselves should read only the first part, those who are tired of fictions should read only the second, and those who are equally interested in both sections should read chapters alternately from each.

Wilhelm, English Dept., Tennessee Technological Univ., Cookeville<br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.This slender volume is not so much a novel as a staged presentation designed to examine the psychodynamics of romantic love. Written by a San Francisco analyst, it suggests that romantic desire is inspired by a need to recapture through another some lost part of oneselfan idea evoked over the epochs from Plato to Prufrock. In support of this theory, the author first offers a novella in which a middle-aged psychoanalyst falls in love with a young female patient. Next, for those who are "weary of story," he supplies a series of "Meditations" to further explicate his premise. Together, they emit some empathetic cries of regret for all those who would engage in that illusory and narcissistic exercise which rejects commonplace happiness "to protest against the loss of Eden." <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Evolutionary Journey: A Personal Guide to a Positive Future</h2><p>We all wish for hope, yet we need an inspirational context, a supportive foundation upon which to base our hope.

Among the colorful players, , there's the resilient daughter of a gangster who not only knows how to combine insider trading with running her late father's garbage disposal business, but who, with Cone's help, learns how to keep the business out of the grasping hands of mobsters and stay alive; the financial tycoon so universally hated it takes a Cone to pick the person who really "offed" him from among all those who wanted to; and the case of the mysterious rise in the stock of a Chinese food company, the investigation of which puts Cone in the crossfire of murderous Chinese gangs. What Sanders (The Anderson Tapes, The Fourth Deadly Sin, The Timothy Files) doesn't know about insider trading, crooked takeover bids, blackmail, greenmail and the way cops and racketeers think and talk is nobody's business.

A chance meeting with a physics professor gives Karl the opportunity to take a one-way trip to Palestine in 29 C.E. There he meets Jesus, who turns out to be vastly different from how history has portrayed him: he&#39;s little more than an imbecile who can barely speak his name. Disillusioned, Karl decides to step in and assume the role of messiah to the lethal end&#34;--Library Journal, 03/01/2007.</p><p>Michael Moorcock was born in 1939, and published his first novel in 1961. As editor of the magazine New Worlds he has been a hugely influential figure in science fiction. He has published more than eighty books, including The Conditions of Muzak, which one the Guardian Fiction Prize. He lives in Texas.Behold The Man won the 1967 Nebula Award. Moorcock is an acknowledged master of fantasy with social and psychological bite, and this extremely controversial novella may well represent the best the fantasy field has to offer in terms of pure literary firepower. Karl Glogauer travels back in time two thousand years, meets John the Baptist, and then seeks Jesus Christ himself. To quote the jacket copy, "What he discovers shocks him to the core." This is a devastating story- science fiction at its most abstract and symbolic. And absolutely unforgettable. I'm ecstatic to have this beautiful corrected 30th Anniversary edition, with foreword by Jonathan Carroll and an afterword by the author, as well as lush illustrations by John Picacio. It's an essential element of any library of the fantastic- be grateful Mojo Press cared enough to make it available again. -- <i>from William D.

Portraying the German immigrant Neumiller family, these stories were extensively revised and became the novel Beyond the Bedroom Wall. Depicting an arduous prairie life, the tales are about birth, domesticity and death. In the expansive, quietly stunning "Burila," a son washes his father's body and fashions his coffin. "Beyond the Bedroom Wall" shows a boy exchanging a look of deep recognition with his mother as she sews, shortly before she dies in childbirth. Women's work is invested with a sacramental gravity: furnishing a home ("The Old Halvorson Place"), the mere lifting of earthenware from a dishpan ("Deathless Lovers") are acts of grace that seem to connect with giving physical, emotional and artistic life. So too, a Guatemalan servant in "She" (one of the three previously uncollected stories, written in the '80s) evokes the narrator's boyhood and affects him like "a story's annealed and wordless core." <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Henry Ford and Grass-Roots America</h2><p>A study of Henry Ford and rural America in the 1920s<br></p><p></p><h2>Reawakenings</h2><p>Meditations on the events and parables in the gospels demonstrate the relevance of these stories and events for contemporary Christians.</p><p>Thomas Keating is the founder of the Centering Prayer movement and a member of the Cistercian Order in the Benedictine tradition who has served at monasteries in Colorado and Massachusetts.

He had not turned up for dinner. Work commitments sometimes took precedence, obviously -- she knew that -- but he only had to call and she would understand. In actual fact, she had put understanding of their profession right at the top of the pluses on her list. It was a Friday and she had a long weekend due; they had planned to drive out to the country and stay overnight at a lovely inn. It was unusual for them both to have time off, so it made it even more annoying that he had not phoned. She had left messages on his mobile but did not like to overkill, as it was possible he was on a call out; however, she knew that he was meant to be winding down the long and tedious inquiry he had been on for months. </p><p> Anna scraped the dried food off the plate into the bin. Tonight had not been the first time by any means and as she sat, tapping her teeth with a pencil, she tried to calculate just how often he had missed dinner. Sometimes he had not even turned up at all, but had gone to stay at his own flat. Although they did, to all intents and purposes, live together, he still kept his place in Kilburn; when he was on a particularly pressing case and working round the clock, he used it rather than disturb her. It was not a bone of contention; sometimes she had even been relieved, although she never admitted it. He also liked to spend quality time there with Kitty, his stepdaughter from his second marriage. All this she could take in her stride, especially if she was also up against it on a case of her own. </p><p> They did not work together; they had not, since they became an item. This was partly due to the Met's once unspoken rule that officers were not to fraternize, especially if assigned to the same case. It had bothered Langton more than Anna, but she had understood his reservations and was quietly relieved that, since the Red Dahlia case, they had been allocated to different inquiries. They had a tacit agreement not to bring work home to each other; she adhered to it, but Langton was often in such a fury that he started swearing and cursing as soon as the front door opened. She had never brought this up, but it had become very one-sided. As he ranted and railed about his team, about the press, about the CPS -- about anything that had got under his skin that day -- he rarely, if ever, asked what her day had been like. This went onto the list of minuses. </p><p> Anna went to stack the dishwasher; God forbid he ever considered moving his cereal bowl from the sink to the dishwasher. He was often in such a rush to get out in the morning that she would find coffee cups in the bedroom, the bathroom, as well as something she had grown to really detest: cigarette butts. If there wasn't an ashtray within arm's reach, he would stub his cigarettes out in his saucer or even in his cereal bowl; to her knowledge, he had never, since they had been together, ever emptied an ashtray. He had never taken the rubbish out to the bins either, or washed a milk bottle and put it out; in fact, he almost used her Maida Vale flat like a hotel. She was the one who sent the linen to the laundry, collected it and made up the beds with fresh sheets; then there was the washing and the ironing. He would leave their bedroom like a war zone: socks, underpants, shirts and pajama bottoms strewn around the room, dropped where he had stepped out of them. There was also the slew of wet towels left on the floor in the bathroom after his morning shower, not to mention the toothpaste without its cap. She had brought up a few of these things and he apologized, promising he would mend his ways, but nothing had changed. </p><p> Anna poured herself a glass of wine. The list of minuses was now two sheets long; the pluses just a couple of lines. Now she got onto bills. He would, when she asked, open his wallet and pass over a couple of hundred pounds, but then often borrowed it back before the end of the week! It wasn't, she concluded, that he was tight-fisted; far from it. It was just that he never thought. This she knew: often he was complaining about his flat being cut off because he'd forgotten to pay his own bills. When he was at home, he ate like a starving man, but had never once accompanied her to do a grocery shop. The plus, if you could call it a plus, was that he did say anything she placed in front of him was good, when she knew her culinary expertise left a lot to be desired. He also downed wine at a rate of knots, and never went to bed without a whiskey; this particular minus was underlined. Langton's drinking had always worried her. He had, on various occasions, gone on one of his drying-out periods; they usually lasted a week or so and were often done to prove that he was not, as she had implied, bordering on alcoholism. He could get into quite an angry mood if she brought it up, insisting he needed to wind down. She kept on writing, however; the drinking at home was one thing, but she knew he also hit the pub with his cohorts on a regular basis. </p><p> Anna emptied her wineglass and poured another; she was getting quite piddled herself, but was determined that when he did come home, it was time for a long talk about their relationship. She knew it was unsatisfactory: very obviously so, when she read through her list. What invariably happened when she had previously attempted to try to make him understand how she felt, was that the plus side of their life together made it never the right moment. He would draw her into his arms at night, so they lay wrapped around each other. She adored the way he would hold her in the curve of his body and nuzzle her neck. His hair was usually wet from the shower and he smelled of her shampoo and soap; many nights, he would shave before coming to bed, as his dark shadow was rough to her skin. His lovemaking left her breathless and adoring; he could be so gentle and yet passionate, and was caring and sensitive to her every whim -- <i>in bed...</i> </p><p> Langton's presence filled her small flat from the moment he walked in the front door until the moment he left, and without him there was such an awful quiet emptiness. Sometimes she enjoyed it, but never for long; she missed him, and loved to hear him running up her front steps. She was always waiting as he let himself in, opened his arms and swung her round as if he'd been away weeks instead of a day. He then dropped his coat and briefcase, kicked off his shoes, and left a trail of discarded garments all over the place as he went into the bedroom to shower. He always showered before they had dinner; he hated the stink of cells, incident rooms and the stale cigarettes that clung to his clothes. After his shower, he would put on an old navy-blue and white dotted dressing-gown and, barefoot, go into the lounge to put the television on. He never settled down to watch any single program, but would switch between news items and the various soaps that he hated with a vengeance. As she cooked, he would yell from the lounge what a load of crap was on TV, then join her to open the wine. Perched on a stool, he would talk about his day: the good, the bad and, sometimes, the hideous. He always had such energy and, in truth, when he did discuss his cases, she was always interested. </p><p> DCI Langton had a special gift; anyone who had ever worked with him knew it and, on the two occasions Anna had been assigned to work on his team, she had learned so much. In fact, living with him made her even more aware of just what a dedicated detective he was. He always looked out for his team and she, more than anyone, knew just how far he had gone to protect her when she had not obeyed the rules. Though he often bent them himself, he was a very clever operator; he had an intuitive mind, but his tendency to be obsessive made him tread a very dangerous line. During the eighteen months they had lived together, even when he had been hard at work all day, she had often seen him working into the early hours, going over and over the case files. He never missed a trick and his prowess at interrogation was notorious. </p><p> Anna sighed. Suddenly all her anger over him missing dinner and her urge to make lists evaporated; all she wanted was to hear his footsteps on the stairs and then his key turn in the lock. After all, she knew he was wrapping up a murder inquiry; doubtless he had just gone for a celebratory drink with the boys. She finished her wine and took a shower, getting ready for bed. She wondered, as it was so late, whether he had gone to his own flat. She rang, but there was no reply. She was about to call his mobile again when she heard footsteps on the stairs. She hurried to be there waiting for him, when she froze, listening. The steps were heavy and slow; instead of hearing the key in the front door, the bell rang. She hesitated; the bell rang again. </p><p> "Who is it?" she asked, listening at the door. </p><p> "It's Mike -- Mike Lewis, Anna." </p><p> She hurried to open the door. She knew instinctively something was wrong. </p><p> "Can I come in?" </p><p> "What is it," she asked, opening the door wide. </p><p> DI Lewis was white-faced and tense. "It's not good news." </p><p> "What's happened?" She could hardly catch her breath. </p><p> "It's Jimmy. He's over at St. Stephen's Hospital." </p><p> Langton and his team had just charged the killer of a young woman. When the man had put in the frame two other members of his street gang, Langton, accompanied by Detectives Lewis and Barolli (close friends, as well as members of his murder team), had gone to investigate. As they approached the two men, one had knifed Langton in the chest, then slashed his thigh. He was in a very serious condition. </p><p> By the time the speeding patrol car reached the hospital, Anna had calmed herself down: no way did she want him to see her scared. As she hurried through the corridors leading to the Intensive Care Unit, she was met by Barolli. </p><p> "How is he?" Lewis asked. </p><p> "Holding his own, but it's touch and go." Barolli reached out and squeezed Anna's hand. "Bastard knifed him with a fucking machete." </p><p> Anna swallowed. The three continued to the ICU. </p><p> Before Anna was allowed to se...</p></p><h2>Silk Road, The&#x2015;China and the Karakorum Highway: A Travel Companion</h2><p>This beautifully&nbsp; illustrated&nbsp; book&nbsp; is intended&nbsp; as background&nbsp; reading&nbsp; for travelers on one of the most popular sections of the Silk Road&#x2014;the Xian to Kashgar route through China, linking&nbsp; with the Karakorum Highway through Northern Pakistan.

It came from the caves by the sea, and because the islanders had built their houses from that rock, which had been the liquid fire of the volcano itself, very soon the weeping rang in all the walls of the buildings, it resounded along the streets, and even the&nbsp;arched entrance of the town wailed at night like an abandoned bride.</i><br> <i>Troubled by this curse, the islanders fought and quarreled among themselves. Fathers disagreed with sons, mothers turned against daughters, neighbors refused to speak to each other; in short, nobody had any peace.</i><br> <i>This continued for many years until, one autumn, a great earthquake came. The islanders were woken by a shuddering at the heart of&nbsp;the island, an awful tremor. The earthquake rattled the cobbles in the&nbsp;streets and the dishes inside the cupboards. Buildings began to tremble like ricotta. By morning, it had knocked every house to the ground.</i><br> <i>While the fallen stones mourned and wept, the islanders came together to decide what must be done.</i><br> <i>A young peasant&#x2019;s daughter by the name of Agata had been visited by a vision of the Madonna, and developed ideas of her own about the curse of weeping. &#x201c;Some sadness has seeped into the stones of the island,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;We must take the ruins and build from them a new town, and when we have done that great labor, the curse of weeping will be gone.&#x201d;</i><br> <i>So the islanders, stone by stone, rebuilt the town.</i><br> <i>From an old tale of the island, in the version first told to me by Pina Vella, recorded at the Sant&#x2019;Agata festival of 1914.<br></i><br> I<br><br> He was woken by a scratching at the window shutters. Therefore he must have slept. &#x201c;The baby is coming!&#x201d; someone called. &#x201c;Signor il dottore!&#x201d;<br> In his great confusion he thought they meant his wife&#x2019;s baby, and was up and at the window in a knot of bedsheets before he recalled that she was sleeping beside him. The face at the window was the peasant Rizzu&#x2019;s, floating like a moon in the dark. &#x201c;Whose baby is it?&#x201d; asked the doctor.<br> &#x201c;Signor il conte&#x2019;s baby. Who else?&#x201d;<br> So as not to wake his wife, he went to the door. The moonlight in the courtyard imposed on everything an odd clarity. Even Rizzu was altered. The peasant had on his Sunday waistcoat and tie; he wore them stiffly, as though nailed into them. &#x201c;This is a mistake,&#x201d; said the doctor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not under instructions to deliver the count&#x2019;s baby.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But I was ordered to fetch you by signor il conte himself.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not under instructions to attend la contessa during her labor. The midwife has had charge of her pregnancy all along. D&#x2019;Isantu must have meant you to fetch her instead.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, no, they already have the midwife. The count wants you, too. Urgently, he said.&#x201d; Rizzu was puffed up with the importance of his message. &#x201c;Will you come? At once?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;My own wife&#x2019;s baby is due very soon. I don&#x2019;t want to go far from home if it can be avoided.&#x201d;<br> But Rizzu would not relinquish his mission. &#x201c;The contessa&#x2019;s baby is due right now, this very moment,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it can be avoided, dottore.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And the midwife can&#x2019;t handle it alone?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, dottore. It&#x2019;s&nbsp;. . . a complicated birth. They need you, because the baby won&#x2019;t come out without those silver sugar--tong things of yours.&#x201d; Rizzu pursed his lips at having to speak directly of such matters; he had witnessed the births of none of his own nine children, preferring to think of them as having sprung out of the earth like Adamo ed Eva. &#x201c;Will you come?&#x201d; he said again.<br> The doctor cursed inwardly, for it was plain that he must. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get my coat; I&#x2019;ll get my hat,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll join you in the road in five minutes. Have you got your donkey cart or are we to walk?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, no, dottore, I brought the cart.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Have it ready.&#x201d;<br> He dressed in the dark. His watch stood at a quarter to two. He packed his instruments: forceps, steel scissors, a set of syringes&#x2014;-all of which he had prepared for his own wife&#x2019;s impending delivery&#x2014;-as well as morphine and magnesium sulfate in case of emergency. When this was done, he disturbed his wife. &#x201c;How often are the pains waking you, amore?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The count&#x2019;s wife has gone into labor early&#x2014;-curse her&#x2014;-and I&#x2019;m called away to attend.&#x201d;<br> She frowned at being woken. &#x201c;Still a long time . . . let me sleep. . . .&#x201d;<br> God willing, he should be able to deliver la contessa&#x2019;s baby and be back in time for his wife&#x2019;s. Before leaving, he ran across the piazza and woke the ancient Gesuina, who had been the island&#x2019;s midwife until she began to lose her sight. &#x201c;Signora Gesuina, mi dispiace,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Will you sit with my wife? I&#x2019;m called to attend to another patient, and my wife has been suffering labor pains.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the other patient?&#x201d; said Gesuina. &#x201c;Blessed Sant&#x2019;Agata, is some other poor soul in the process of dying on this godforsaken -island, that you have to leave her at such a time?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The count&#x2019;s wife has gone into labor early, and there are complications&#x2014;-they need me to bring the forceps.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The count&#x2019;s wife, eh? And you&#x2019;ve been called to attend her?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Yes, signora.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;From what I&#x2019;ve heard, you&#x2019;ve your reasons for preferring not to deliver signora la contessa&#x2019;s baby.&#x201d; The old woman fell into a silence full of portent.<br> &#x201c;What have you heard, Signora Gesuina?&#x201d; The doctor was unable to suppress his irritation.<br> &#x201c;Rumors,&#x201d; said Gesuina.<br> &#x201c;Anyway, will you come and sit with her?&#x201d;<br> Gesuina collected herself. &#x201c;Yes, by Sant&#x2019;Agata, of course. Where are you, boy? Let me catch hold of you, so I don&#x2019;t lose my footing on these troublesome stones.&#x201d;<br> The woman really was almost blind. Gesuina followed him across the square, holding the hem of his coat, and installed herself on a chair in the corner of the bedroom. He hoped the sight of the ancient figure would not alarm his wife if she woke.<br> Already it was past two. He kissed her forehead and left her.<br> Still cursing, he went in search of Rizzu and his donkey cart. Damn the count and his wife. She had refused to have him attend to her pregnancy, preferring the ministrations of the island&#x2019;s midwife. Why now this haste in calling him to the villa, at two in the morning? This complication of hers was probably no more than a twisted cord or a particularly violent pain, and there was no need of the forceps at all&#x2014;-and yet his own wife must be left unattended while he rode across town on their orders.<br> Rizzu was waiting, with his hat in his hands as though at Mass. They mounted his donkey cart, a fanciful contraption in green and yellow. Its painted panels told the stories of great battles, shipwrecks, and miracles belonging to the island. It was not a vehicle designed for haste. In a silence threaded with the blue crash of the sea, they traveled the sleeping streets. The moon burnished the palm leaves and lit the dusty back of the donkey. &#x201c;Two babies due on the whole island,&#x201d; grumbled the doctor. &#x201c;My wife&#x2019;s and the contessa&#x2019;s, and both of them come at once. Who would be a medico condotto?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; said Rizzu, who was not much inclined to express his opinion on the trials of country doctors. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a double blessing, though, dottore, isn&#x2019;t it? Two babies born on the same night&#x2014;-it&#x2019;s never happened on the island before.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a double inconvenience.&#x201d;<br> They reached the count&#x2019;s gate at twenty past two. The doctor took his coat, his hat, his bag and stethoscope, and made off down the drive at a jog, the sooner to be finished with this business.<br> The count was standing sentinel outside his wife&#x2019;s bedroom in the modern part of the house. The electric glare on his face gave him a sweaty, reptilian look. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re late,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I sent for you nearly an hour ago.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t under instructions to attend this birth at all.&#x201d; Irritation made the doctor forthright. &#x201c;My own wife is in the early stages of labor; she&#x2019;s had pains on and off for days. It&#x2019;s damned inconvenient to leave her. And I thought la contessa wanted only the midwife in attendance.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She did. It was I who sent for you. Carmela is in here; you&#x2019;d better see for yourself.&#x201d;<br> The count stepped aside to allow the doctor to push past his bulk and into the countess&#x2019;s room. The electricity, newly installed, made everything pallid. The midwife was at work with a primal rhythm: breathe, push, breathe, push. But Carmela did not breathe, did not push, and he could see now that it wasn&#x2019;t just a matter of a twisted cord or a particularly violent pain. For a patient at this stage not to push was never a good omen. He did not often feel fear at his work, but now he felt it, dragging like a cold current across his shoulder blades.<br> &#x201c;At last, you!&#x201d; said the midwife in contempt.<br> A tiny maid quaked at the foot of the bed&#x2014;-what was her name? Pierangela&#x2014;-he had treated her once for bunions. &#x201c;Bring me something to wash my hands,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;How long has the patient been like this?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh, Lord&#x2014;-hours, signor il dottore!&#x201d; wept Pierangela, bringing soap and hot water.<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s been suffering convulsions for an hour,&#x201d; corrected the midwife, &#x201c;and then these fits of exhaustion when she seems to see nothing and nobody.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;When was the onset of contractions?&#x201d; asked the doctor.<br> &#x201c;Early yesterday morning I was called in. Seven o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;<br> Seven o&#x2019;clock. For nineteen hours, then, they had been at this struggle. &#x201c;And it was a simple pregnancy?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; The midwife thrust a stack of papers at him&#x2014;-as though it would help to read her case notes now! &#x201c;La contessa has been confined to bed this past month with swollen hands and violent headaches. I&#x2019;d have thought you would have known,&#x201d; she muttered.<br> &#x201c;Swollen hands!&#x201d; said the doctor. &#x201c;Headaches! Why wasn&#x2019;t I called?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;La contessa refused,&#x201d; said the midwife.<br> &#x201c;But you&#x2014;-you could have called me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Signor il conte&#x2019;s mainland doctor saw her last week. He said it was nothing. What could I do?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She should be delivering in the hospital in Siracusa, not here!&#x201d; The doctor rounded on the midwife and the terrified Pierangela. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the tools to perform a cesarean section! I don&#x2019;t even have enough morphine!&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She refused to see you,&#x201d; said the midwife. &#x201c;I suspected a preeclamptic state, dottore, but no one ever listens to me in such matters.&#x201d;<br> This throwing up of hands enraged him. &#x201c;You should have fought to get her into the hospital,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You should have insisted on it!&#x201d;<br> Pierangela began a spontaneous lamentation: &#x201c;Holy - -Ges� - and-Mary - -Mother - -of - -God, Sant&#x2019;Agata - -saint - -of --misfortunes - -and - -all -the--saints&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br> The knowledge of what had to be done came to steady his hands. It always did, sooner or later. &#x201c;Get everybody out of the way,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Prepare boiling water, clean sheets. Everything must be clean.&#x201d;<br> The water was brought, the sheets stripped from under the limp body of Carmela. The doctor sterilized a syringe, loaded it with magnesium sulfate, and injected it into her arm. The work led him now from task to task as though it were some ritual, the noon angelus or the rosary. He prepared morphine, steel scissors, forceps. &#x201c;Find a needle and thread,&#x201d; he told the midwife. &#x201c;Prepare swabs, prepare -iodine. You&#x2019;ll find it all in my bag.&#x201d;<br> Carmela, in a moment of clarity, spoke. &#x201c;I wanted only the midwife,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Not you.&#x201d;<br> Without addressing her directly, the doctor said, &#x201c;That can&#x2019;t be helped now. We need to deliver the baby as soon as possible.&#x201d;<br> He prepared the morphine and injected her slender arm once more. While Carmela sagged under the weight of the drugs, he lifted the scissors and planned his incision, making it first in the air. One neat inch--long snip. The sheets&#x2014;-where were the sheets? &#x201c;Bring the clean ones,&#x201d; he ordered. &#x201c;At once.&#x201d;<br> Pierangela stumbled about in consternation. &#x201c;Everything must be clean!&#x201d; raged the doctor, who had learned his trade in the mud and ice of the trenches at Trentino. &#x201c;Everything. If the fits don&#x2019;t kill her, sepsis will.&#x201d;<br> Carmela, again lucid, met his eyes, and her own were sharpened with fear, the way he had seen a hundred etherized soldiers look during the war, when they surfaced. He put the back of his hand on her shoulder. Something altered in her at his touch, as he had known it would. She lifted her head and, with all the force of a malediction, said, &#x201c;This is your doing.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Give her more morphine,&#x201d; he told the midwife.<br> &#x201c;This is your doing,&#x201d; Carmela said again. &#x201c;The child is yours. Everyone suspects it but you. Why won&#x2019;t you look at me, Amedeo?&#x201d;<br> He injected her without even glancing at her face, but he could feel the room tighten under the force of the accusation. As soon as Carmela sank again he knelt and made a single incision, reached inside for the baby, and turned it by a quarter. Then, with the aid of the forceps, he delivered it in one motion into the room.<br> A boy&#x2014;-already breathing. He cut the cord and deposited it in the arms of the midwife. &#x201c;She still isn&#x2019;t safe until the placenta is delivered,&#x201d; he said. Then, in a slither, the whole mass of it came free, and everything was over in a confusion of blood and weeping.<br> Carmela began to revive in the following minutes, as he had known she would. She hauled herself up on the damp sheets and demanded the baby. Relief, and the burden of hiding it, made him nauseous. He went to the window. He looked down the avenue that led from the count&#x2019;s door to the road. He saw how the lamps among the trees made spheres of green light. He saw how, beyond them, the vista was melancholy, just the empty hillside and the black and endless sea. Everything was altered since he had last looked upon these things. The room was altered. Carmela was altered. He would not have recognized either.<br> When he had steadied himself, he returned to his patients. He checked Carmela&#x2019;s heartbeat, the baby&#x2019;s heartbeat. He stitched the incision he had made and swabbed everything with iodine. He presided over the burning of the placenta, the bloody sheets, the swabs and bandages. Only then did he allow himself to look properly at Carmela. Absorbed in contemplation of the baby, she was unaware of him now. Strange to think that the body which labor had so assaulted, which he had injected and incised and manhandled on the bed just now, had been whole and young when he had last seen her. This is your doing, she had said. The child is yours. He allowed himself one brief glance at the baby. A lusty boy with a puff of black hair&#x2014;-why, a baby at this stage could belong to anyone. It seemed as he studied it to assume the count&#x2019;s features, his jowly neck and protruding eyes.<br> But either way, she had accused him, and that was what mattered.<br> A great tiredness came over him now that his work was accomplished. The count came to the door, and Carmela was hastily wiped and covered. It fell upon the doctor to announce the birth. This he did, with more bravado than he felt, playing his own part, bringing forth the expected phrases: &#x201c;A fine child&nbsp;. . . a strong boy&nbsp;. . . case of eclampsia&nbsp;. . . hope for a good recovery.&#x201d;<br> The count inspected the baby and inspected his wife, then gave the doctor a nod, and he understood that he was dismissed.<br> Unwanted now at the scene, he cleaned his instruments, packed them, and made his way through the dim passages of the ...</p><h2>Food Sake Tokyo (The Terroir Guides)</h2><p>Chef, sommelier, journalist, and restaurant consultant Yukari Sakamoto guides the reader through the gourmet delights of this fascinating city&#x2014;from the world&#x2019;s largest fish market to the Kappabashi kitchenware district. <br><br>She is a Japanese American whose insider&#x2019;s view of Japanese cuisine started when she took a unique position in the depachika (epicurean food hall) at the world-renowned Takashimaya department store in Tokyo.

He was also beloved and reviled for his radical, idealistic, yet classically traditional views on a wide range of heretical topics, from sacred practices of the Stone Age to the evils of the metric system to the madness of modernity and the unfolding apocalypse. <br> <br>Carefully selecting 108 of Michell&#x2019;s most insightful, erudite, witty, and occasionally scathing essays from his column in the monthly magazine <i>The Oldie</i>, esoteric scholar Joscelyn Godwin presents a colorful collection of Michell&#x2019;s writings and rants that cover nearly every aspect of society, history, and traditional wisdom. In these short essays, Michell takes on agribusiness, Darwinism, superstition, Stonehenge, the insanity of modern society, UFOs, Jesus, fairies, the Grail legend, among many other topics. No matter how small the topic under consideration, Michell always takes a larger view on it, illuminating it with light from above. <br> <br>Godwin&#x2019;s artful selection and ordering of essays reveals Michell&#x2019;s overarching grand view of the world at large. We glimpse the heart of Michell as idealistic Platonist and radical traditionalist, absorb his common sense lessons for living in tune with the divine order, and are reminded that the elusive &#x201c;paradise of the philosophers&#x201d; of ancient times is still within reach for those with the strength of vision to see it.</p><p>John Michell (1933-2009), educated at Eton and Cambridge, was the pioneer researcher and specialist in the field of ancient, traditional science. Author of more than twenty-five books, his work has profoundly influenced modern thinking, including <i>The Sacred Center</i>, <i>The Dimensions of Paradise</i>, <i>The New View Over Atlantis</i>, <i>Secrets of the Stones</i>, and <i>The Temple of Jerusalem: A Revelation</i>.<br><br>Joscelyn Godwin was born in Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, England on January 16, 1945. He was educated as a chorister at Christ Church Cathedral School, Oxford, then at Radley College (Music Scholar), and Magdalene College, Cambridge (Music Scholar; B.A., 1965, Mus. B., 1966, M.A. 1969). Coming to the USA in 1966, he did graduate work in Musicology at Cornell University (Ph. D., 1969; dissertation: "The Music of Henry Cowell") and taught at Cleveland State University for two years before joining the Colgate University Music Department in 1971. He has taught at Colgate ever since.<b>Introduction <br>&#x201c;A Prophetic Vision&#x201d; By Joscelyn Godwin</b> <br> <br>It is not too much to say that John Michell was a prophet. Prophets do not foretell the future so much as warn what may come to pass if events continue on their present course. Nowadays this is so blindingly obvious that we hardly need prophets to tell it to us. But there is a rarer prophetic gift, which is the seeing of forms in what Plato called the World of Ideas--not the imaginary ideas of men and women, but the divine or daemonic ideas after which the material world is formed. Ezekiel saw the Chariot of the Most High; John the Divine saw the New Jerusalem; Mohammed in his night-journey passed through the planetary spheres and met the other prophets of his lineage. Such visions may be warnings too, but they also inspire confidence in the meaning and goodness of the cosmos; they enable us to imagine Paradise here and now, and to adjust our lives in harmony with it. <br> <br>John Michell&#x2019;s other role was that of a guardian of tradition and its defender against the &#x201c;new men&#x201d; who mistrust everything ancient, beautiful, or suspect of elitism. These tinpot emperors come in for a sound chastisement in these pages, and it is not sheer malice to enjoy hearing someone shout that they are stark naked. The tradition that Michell defends has always been elitist, but not in the sense of favoring birth, money, or even brains. Instead, it fosters the quality, in every sphere, of being truly and comfortably what one is. In this sense, those who live by cultivating the land or by the careful work of their hands are more deserving of respect than media stars (even royal ones) or socialites. Moreover, Michell has a particular empathy for those at the bottom of the ladder, who might have found their place in a more traditional social order but whom present-day conditions have made outsiders. <br> <br><b>5 <br>Staying Put and Rushing About <br>March 2001 <br></b> <br>My grandmother used to say, &#x201c;You young people are so restless, always rushing about from here to there. When we were girls it was so lovely at home that we never wanted to leave, even to get married.&#x201d; <br> <br>It is true that we were always rushing about, in dangerous motor cars, with desperate episodes of drunken driving. I shudder now to think of it. In Granny&#x2019;s youth there were no motors, so staying put was the normal thing in the country. But later it became a sort of disgrace, and now everyone keeps going away, rushing about in planes and boasting about their constant, far-flung travels as if there were virtue in their restlessness. <br> <br>Americans are at the forefront of this movement--they are said to move house on average every three or four years--but all our colonials are the same. Unable to settle properly in the lands they took from the natives, with no traditional ties to the landscapes they were born in, they are condemned to wander, and that is why we have the pleasure of so many overseas visitors each year. <br> <br>A few generations ago, when the enchantment of old England still lingered in country districts, most villagers had never been farther than the local market town, and many had never set foot outside their own parish. It was like in that Chinese poem about the idyllic community, where nothing unusual ever happened, where it was so quiet that they could hear dogs barking in the next village, which none of them had ever gone to. <br> <br>One of my hobbies is collecting examples of good people who have enjoyed long lives, happy and complete, while scarcely moving an inch from where they were born. It began during the Falklands war, when a reporter said that he had met islanders in the outlying &#x201c;campo&#x201d; who had never been to the capital, Port Stanley, in their whole lives. Then, in the way these things happen, I heard from another journalist something even more extraordinary, that on the island of St. Helena, which is only ten miles across at most, there were rustics who had never been to their only town, Jamestown. <br> <br>Best of all was the example of staying put which I came across in a book about the Faroe Islands by two highly informed and entertaining subarctic women, Liv K. Schei and Ounnie Moberg (they also wrote the best modern book on Shetland). On the remotest island of the Faroes, Fugloy, barely two miles long and with two small villages, they heard of a woman who lived in one of the villages and had never bothered to visit the other one. Nor had she ever left the island. On her seventieth birthday the treat she asked for was to be shown the next village. It was a few minutes&#x2019; walk and she thoroughly enjoyed the novelty. <br> <br>A traditional view of such lives is that they are compensations for hyperactivity in a previous existence. At the end of Plato&#x2019;s <i>Republic</i> is a description of souls destined for rebirth, where each was allowed to choose the pattern of its next life. The foolish among them grabbed lives of wealth and power, only to find too late that they ended nastily. Among the last souls to pick a life was Ulysses, whose former career was of constant rushing around. Most of the lives had gone, but thrown away in a corner he found the life of a quiet, retiring country gentleman. That, he said, would have been his choice if he had had first pick. So in one life you rush around and in the next you stay put. <br> <br>That is only a story, but it is the best one you are likely to find that accounts for the coexistence in human nature of those opposite types that you see in children, the one who sits there happily and the one who simply cannot keep still.</p><h2>Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site</h2><p>As the sun sets behind the big construction site, all the hardworking trucks get ready to say goodnight.

The war was almost over and the German aristocrats and SS officers dancing and drinking knew it was lost. Around midnight, some of the guests were asked to "take care" of 180 Jewish enslaved laborers at the train station; they made them strip naked and shot them all before returning to the bright lights of the party. It was another one of the war's countless atrocities buried in secrecy for decades--until Sacha Batthyany started investigating what happened that night at the party his great aunt hosted.<br><br><i>A Crime in the Family</i> is the author's memoir of confronting his family's past, the questions he raised and the answers he found that took him far beyond his great aunt's party: through the dark past of Nazi Germany to the gulags of Siberia, the bleak streets of Cold War Budapest, and to Argentina, where he finds an Auschwitz survivor whose past intersects with his family's. It is the story of executioners and victims, villains and heroes.<br><br>Told partly through the surviving family journals, <i>A Crime in the Family </i>is a disquieting and moving memoir, a powerful true story told by an extraordinary writer confronting the dark past of his family--and humanity.<br></p><p><b>Sacha Batthyany </b>was born in Switzerland in 1973 to Hungarian emigre parents.

During the terms of Presidents Truman and Eisenhower, she was a notable activist, particularly in 1945 after her appointment as the only U.S. woman delegate to the first meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in London. Her reflections on that experience and on human rights issues are couched in terms of responsible citizenship and individual conscience. The columns, here edited by freelancer Emblidge, cover a wide range of public issues and personal concerns, from her first encounter with a homeless person to becoming a working widow--all presented in a voice that resonated for countless Americans. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This sampling of Eleanor Roosevelt's "My Day" columns, which she wrote for nearly 30 years, takes up where volume 1 left off in 1945 following the death of President Roosevelt. During this time Roosevelt served as the first U.S. woman delegate to the United Nations and as chair of the Committee on Human Rights. These short pieces reflect her high moral values and broad interests, from the mundane and personal to the sweeping and reformist. As LJ' s reviewer said of volume 1, "for those knowing her only as a historical figure the columns offer a sense of the way Roosevelt touched contemporaries" ( LJ 3/15/89).

Laudan both destroys and creates. With detailed, scathing criticisms, he attacks the 'pregnant confusions' in extant philosophies of science. The progress they espouse derives from strictly empirical criteria, he complains, and this clashes with historical evidence. Accordingly, Laudan constructs a remedy from historical examples that involves nothing less than the redefinition of scientific rationality and progress . . . Surprisingly, after this reshuffling, science still looks like a noble-and progressive-enterprise ... The glory of Laudan's system is that it preserves scientific rationality and progress in the presence of social influence. We can admit extra-scientific influences without lapsing into complete relativism. . . a must for both observers and practitioners of science."&nbsp;--<i>Physics Today</i>&nbsp;"A critique and substantial revision of the historic theories of scientific rationality and progress (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos, Feyerabend, etc.). Laudan focuses on contextual problem solving effectiveness (carefully defined) as a criterion for progress, and expands the notion of 'paradigm' to a 'research tradition,' thus providing a meta-empirical basis for the commensurability of competing theories. From this perspective, Laudan suggests revised programs for history and philosophy of science, the history of ideas, and the sociology of science. A superb work, closely argued, clearly written, and extensively annotated, this book will become a widely required text in intermediate courses."--<i>Choice</i></p><p><b>Larry Laudan</b> is a contemporary philosopher of science and epistemologist.

Allen Boone struggles to become the pupil, with the small simian as a teacher whose wisdom is not measured in words, but in his ability to vibrate with life s pulsations. Other characters are horses, gophers, seagulls and two remarkable and faithful dogs, Sally and Bomber. A chapter entitled The Love Compass tells of a mysterious power animals possess. Boone teaches the reader how to learn the silent language and become a master at interspecies relationships. In his thoughtful tales he speaks silently with all forms of life and grows to understand their silent replies. Boone never looked down on animals as lesser creatures; rather he looked across at them as companions in the grand adventure of life. His cultivated mental affinity with nature allowed him to see that everything that lives has something of value to share with us.</p><p>J.

This blistering portrayal of a man who feels himself to be half-human and half-wolf was the bible of the 1960s counterculture, capturing the mood of a disaffected generation, and remains a haunting story of estrangement and redemption.</p><p>Herman Hesse was born in southern Germany in 1877. Hesse concentrated on writing poetry as a young man, but his first successful book was a novel, Peter Camenzind (1904). During the war, Hesse was actively involved in relief efforts. Depression, criticism for his pacifist views, and a series of personal crises led Hesse to undergo psychoanalysis with J. B. Lang. Out of these years came Demian (1919), a novel whose main character is torn between the orderliness of bourgeois existence and the turbulent and enticing world of sensual experience. This dichotomy is prominent in Hesse&#39;s subsequent novels, including Siddhartha (1922), Steppenwolf (1927), and Narcissus and Goldmund (1930). Hesse worked on his magnum opus, The Glass Bead Game (1943), for twelve years. This novel was specifically cited when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946.

While the cause of death is clear, the officer's identity is not. With nerve ends raw from the media focus on recent scandals, the Pentagon bypasses its own investigative service and appoints a commander, Dan Collins, and a civilian, Grace Snow, to conduct an inquiry. Together they resolve to ignore the Navy's political sensitivities and conduct a by-the-book murder investigation. But then they uncover evidence that points back to Washington, D.C., and a two-year-old unsolved case involving another black Navy lieutenant, a beautiful young woman, who died under violent circumstances. While they search for links between the two deaths, they attract the attention of one Malachi Ward. Cunning, ruthless, well paid, and ferociously resourceful, he will do whatever it takes to protect his hidden client's privilege. In a tense, deadly game of cat-and-mouse, Malachi tracks Collins and Snow through Washington's streets and corridors of power, determined to keep them from learning the secret behind the body in the battleship. <br></p><p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

An important book that has the added pleasure of reading like a spy novel.&#x201d; &#x2014;David Grann, author of <em>The Lost City of Z</em> </p><p>Award-winning reporter Eamon Javers&#x2019;s <em>Broker, Trader, Lawyer, Spy</em> is a penetrating work of investigative and historical journalism about the evolution of corporate espionage, exploring the dangerous and combustible power spies hold over international business. From the birth of the Pinkertons to Howard Hughes, from presidents to Cold War spies, <em>Broker, Trader, Lawyer, Spy</em> is, like <em>Legacy of Ashes</em> and <em>Blackwater</em>, a first rate political thriller that also just happens to be true.</p></p><p><p>In this penetrating work of investigative and historical journalism, Eamon Javers explores the dangerous and combustible power spies hold over international business.</p><p>Today's global economy has a dark underbelly: the world of corporate espionage. Using cutting-edge technology, age-old techniques of deceit and manipulation, and sheer talent, spies act as the hidden puppeteers of globalized businesses. They control markets, determine prices, influence corporate decisions, and manage the flow of data and information of some of the world's biggest corporations. In his gripping and alarming book, Eamon Javers takes the reader inside this hidden global industry. Readers meet the spies who conduct surveillance operations, satellite analysts who peer down on corporate targets from the skies, veteran CIA officers who work for hedge funds, and even a Soviet military intelligence officer who now sells his services to American companies.</p><p>This industry has tentacles in almost every industry in almost every corner of the globe. Intelligence companies and the spies they employ are setting up fake Web sites to elicit information, trailing individuals and mirroring travel itiner-aries, Dumpster-diving in household and corporate trash, using ultrasophisticated satellite surveillance to spy on facilities, acting as impostors to take jobs within companies or to gain access to corporations, concocting elaborate schemes of fraud and deceit, and hacking e-mail and secure computer networks. The work of this industry can be ingenious, but it also raises crucial moral and legal questions in a world where global conflicts are as likely to be corporation versus corporation as they are to be nation versus nation.</p><p>This globalized industry is not a recent phenomenon, but rather a continuation of a fascinating history. The story begins with Allan Pinkerton, the nation's first true "private eye," and extends through the annals of a rich history that includes tycoons and playboys, presidents and FBI operatives, CEOs and accountants, Cold War veterans and military personnel. Built on exclusive reporting and unprecedented access, this book features accounts of Howard Hughes's private CIA, the extensive spying that took place in a battle between two global food companies, and interviews with some of the world's top corporate surveillance experts.</p><p>A Washington reporter for CNBC, Eamon Javers was previously a correspondent for <em>Politico</em> and a Washington correspondent for <em>BusinessWeek</em>. The recipient of an award from the Medill School of Journalism for his investigative reporting, Javers has appeared on CNN, FOX News, MSNBC, and the BBC.

And, hey, surely drug addicts are skinny?&#39; Rachel is living it up in New York City, spending her nights talking her way into glamorous parties before heading home in the early hours to her hot boyfriend Luke. Then her sensible older sister shows up and even though it seems like a bad joke, she finds herself in actual rehab. It&#39;s there that she&#39;s supposed to kick her non-existent drug habit - and to get over losing Luke. Luke&#39;s a fox; he&#39;s also strong and kind, but he has had more than he can take of Rachel. None of this was part of her plan and saying goodbye to fun will be hard. But not as hard as losing the man that, too late, she believes might be the love of her life . . . &#39;Gloriously funny&#39; Sunday Times &#39;A born storyteller&#39; Independent on Sunday &#39;The voice of a generation&#39; Daily Mirror</p><p>Marian Keyes is the international bestselling author of Watermelon, Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, Rachel's Holiday, Last Chance Saloon, Sushi for Beginners, Angels, The Other Side of the Story, Anybody Out There, This Charming Man, The Brightest Star in the Sky, The Mystery of Mercy Close and The Woman Who Stole My Life.

Marian lives in Dublin with her husband.<p>They said I was a drug addict. I found that hard to come to terms with -- I was a middle-class, convent-educated girl whose drug use was strictly recreational. And surely drug addicts were thinner? It was true that I took drugs, but what no one seemed to understand was that my drug use wasn't any different from their having a drink or two on a Friday night after work. They might have a few vodkas and tonic and let off a bit of steam. I had a couple of lines of cocaine and did likewise. As I said to my father and my sister and my sister's husband and eventually the therapists of the Cloisters, "If cocaine was sold in liquid form, in a bottle, would you complain about me taking it? Well, would you? No, I bet you wouldn't!"</p><p>I was offended by the drug-addict allegation, because I was nothing like one. Apart from the track marks on their arms, they had dirty hair, constantly seemed cold, did a lot of shoulder-hunching, wore cheap sneakers that looked like they'd been bought in Woolworth's, and were, as I've already mentioned, thin.</p><p>I wasn't thin.</p><p>Although it wasn't for the want of trying. I spent plenty of timeon the Stairmaster at the gym. But no matter how much I stairmastered, genetics had the final say. If my father had married a dainty little woman, I might have had a very different life. Very different thighs, certainly.</p><p>Instead, like my two older sisters, Claire and Margaret, I was doomed for people always to describe me by saying, "She's a big girl." Then they always added really quickly "Now, I'm not saying she's fat."</p><p>The implication being that if I was fat, I could at least do something about it.</p><p>"No," they would continue, "she's a fine, big, tall girl. You know, strong."</p><p>I was often described as strong.</p><p>It really pissed me off.</p><p>My boyfriend, Luke, sometimes described me as magnificent. (When the light was behind me and he'd had several beers.) At least that was what he said to me. Then he probably went back to his friends and said, "Now, I'm not saying she's fat. . . "</p><p>The whole drug-addict allegation came about one February morning when I was living in New York.</p><p>It wasn't the first time I felt as if I was on Cosmic Candid Camera. My life was prone to veering out of control and I had long stopped believing that the God who had been assigned to me was a benign old guy with long hair and a beard. He was more like a celestial stand-up comic, and my life was the showcase he used to amuse the other Gods.</p><p>"Wa-atch," he laughingly invites, "as Rachel thinks she's got a new job and that it's safe to hand in her notice on the old. Little does she know that her new firm is just about to go bankrupt!"</p><p>Roars of laughter from all the other gods.</p><p>"Now, wa-atch," he chuckles, "as Rachel hurries to meet her new boyfriend. See how she catches the heel of her shoe in a grating? See how it comes clean off? Little did Rachel know that we had tampered with it. See how she limps the rest of the way?" More sniggers from the assembled gods.</p><p>"But the best bit of all," he laughs, "is that the man she was meeting never turns up! He only asked her out for a bet. Watch as Rachel squirms with embarrassment in the stylish bar. See the looks of pity the other women give her? See how the waiter gives her the extortionate bill for a glass of wine, and best of all, see how Rachel discovers she's left her purse at home?"</p><p>Uncontrollable guffaws.</p><p>The events that led to me being called a drug addict had the same element of celestial farce that the rest of my life had. What happened was, one night I'd sort of overdone it on the enlivening drugs and I couldn't get to sleep. (I hadn't meant to overdo it, I had simply underestimated the quality of the cocaine that I had taken.) I knew I had to get up for work the following morning, so I took a couple of sleeping pills. After about ten minutes, they hadn't worked, so I took a couple more. And still my head was buzzing, so in desperation, thinking of how badly I needed my sleep, thinking of how alert I had to be at work, I took a few more.</p><p>I eventually got to sleep. A lovely deep sleep. So lovely and deep that when the morning came, and my alarm clock went off, I neglected to wake up.</p><p>Brigit, my roommate, knocked on my door, then came into my room and shouted at me, then shook me, then, at her wit's end, slapped me. (I didn't really buy the "wit's end" bit. She must have known that slapping wouldn't wake me, but no one is in good form on a Monday morning.)</p><p>But then Brigit stumbled across a piece of paper that I'd been attempting to write on just before I fell asleep. It was just the usual maudlin, mawkish, self-indulgent poetry-type stuff I often wrote when I was under the influence. Stuff that seemed really profound at the time, where I thought I'd discovered the secret of the universe, but that caused me to blush with shame when I read it in the cold light of day -- the parts that I <i>could</i> read, that is.</p><p>The poem went something like "Mumble, mumble, life..." something indecipherable, "bowl of cherries, mumble, all I get is the pits..." Then -- and I vaguely remembered writing this part -- I thought of a really good title for a poem about a shoplifter who had suddenly discovered her conscience. It was called <i>I can't take anymore.</i></p></p><h2>The Story of Canada</h2><p>From the epic journeys into the unknown by the first people who crossed the Bering land bridge thousands of years ago to Roberta Bondar's landmark voyage into space, The Story of Canada is as vast in scope as the country itself. <p>Authors Janet Lunn and Christopher Moore tell the country's story through rich narrative, recreations of daily life, folk tales, and fascinating facts.

Teresita Fern�ndez creates elaborate installations that pull viewers into other worlds and environments, playing with scale, material and how we understand and navigate the landscape. The idea of wayfinding&#x2014;moving from place to place or even getting lost&#x2014;is critical to understanding Fern�ndez&#x2019;s approach, which incorporates unconventional materials such as graphite, pyrite, dyed thread, polycarbonate tubes, gold and malachite to explore how we look at and process our surroundings from land to sky, private to public. This book is a journey designed as constellation of works rather than a chronological retrospective, inviting readers to explore Fern�ndez&#x2019;s oeuvre through large, full-color illustrations; writings on place; references to literature, film, art history, and poetry, alongside Fern�ndez&#x2019;s own writings; and critical essays. Organized into six sections&#x2014;landscape, celestial, terrestrial, subterranean, cinematic, and radiance&#x2014; which reflect themes recurring in Fern�ndez&#x2019;s practice, this volume spans her full career. The result is a dramatically rich experience of getting to know an artist through her creative process&#x2014;a rewarding journey that will satisfy general readers and scholars alike.</p><p>Denise Markonish is Curator at MASS MoCA in North Adams, Massachusetts.</p><h2>The Education of the Heart: Readings and Sources for Care of the Soul, Soul Mates, and The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life</h2><p>Don't you ever, <br> You up in the sky, <br> Don't you ever get tired <br> Of having the clouds between you and us? <br>-- Nootka Prayer <p> There are Sweets of Pathos, when Sweets of Mirth have passed away -- <br>-- Emily Dickinson </p><p> With their themes of restoring the soul, cultivating humanity and living a more harmonious and spiritual existence, Thomas Moore's classic books have touched and comforted millions of people across the country, created a burgeoning interest in soul work and made Thomas Moore a household name. To date, these books have sold two and a half million copies, and continue to hit bestseller lists every week. </p><p> <em>The Education of the Heart</em> &nbsp; gives readers access to the wellspring of wisdom that Moore drew on when creating these seminal works. Ideal for reading groups, the book includes a study guide that offers suggestions for discussion. Selected not only for their brilliance in describing the soul, but for the beauty and power of their language, the essays, poems, songs and passages included here make the book a truly rewarding reading experience. Arranged into chapters devoted to topics such as marriage and intimacy, common life, dwelling and home and life passages, these selections are taken from a rich variety of sources: from Greek tragedies and ancient magical texts; from the Renaissance philosophers such as Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola; and from modern archetypal psychologists such as C. G. Jung and James Hillman. </p><p> As Thomas Moore says in his introduction, "Meditate on the book, read the passages aloud, write them down for future reference, tell them to friends, commit them to memory; These are all ways of educating the heart."</p></p><p><p>Thomas Moore is the author of the bestselling <em>Care of the Soul</em> and twenty other books on spirituality and depth psychology that have been translated into thirty languages. He has been practicing depth psychotherapy for thirty-five years. He lectures and gives workshops in several countries on depth spirituality, soulful medicine, and psychotherapy. He has been a monk and a university professor, and is a consultant for organizations and spiritual leaders. He has often been on television and radio, most recently on Oprah Winfrey&#x2019;s Super Soul Sunday.</p><p></p>Since Thomas Moore's name on a book attracts hundreds of thousands, this collection of passages that have inspired Moore in writing his best-sellers <i>Care of the Soul</i> (1992), <i>Soul Mates</i> (1993), and <i>The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life</i> may attract a readership much broader than such a work usually does these days. (Early in this century, such inspirational gatherings helped make Elbert Hubbard internationally famous.) Moore says he has designed the book to be equally rewarding whether randomly browsed, read cover to cover, or used as a text for individual or class study of the soul. He separately introduces each of the 8 sections and 24 chapters in which he arrays the selections. Most of the authors are theologians, philosophers, psychologists, and poets, and they are a top-drawer lot: Jesus, Plato, Homer, Emerson, Ficino, Origen, Boethius, Gandhi, Eliot, Jung, Yeats--good company, indeed. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>Daniel s Prophecy of the 70 Weeks</h2><p>We believe this work is culturally important.

Originally published in 1927, this 569 page book is one of the classics on Eastern Frontier Indian history. From the formation of the Iroquois confederation in 1570 through Cornplanter s death in 1836, Sipe discusses the tribes that inhabited Pennsylvania and how their forced migration westward across the Allegheny mountains of Pennsylvania into the Ohio country lit the fires that would keep the western frontier ablaze for the next forty years. As you read Indian Chiefs, you begin to know and understand the motivation the Indians had in trying to hold onto their native land and the conflicts that would result. Pennsylvania was the gateway to the west through which all the major players of the Indian wars would pass: Indian traders, frontiersmen, and pioneer families. The final 100 pages detail Indian events of PA during the Revolutionary War complete with a chronological table of leading events in the Indian history of Pennsylvania.</p><p></p><h2>Things Left Unspoken: A Novel</h2><p>Jo Lynn Hunter is at a crossroads in life when her greataunt Stella insists that she return home to restore the old family house in sleepy Cottonwood, Georgia.

If you consider it being nature&#x2019;s best and most excellent tonic, it is not going to be an exaggeration. That is the reason why newborn babies in the East are fed honey, the moment they enter the world and are bathed, before they are given to their proud moms for their first feed. That is because this is a predigested food, and it is easy to digest, is nutritious, and is health giving. And the best thing about Honey is that you may keep it for a long while, and it is not going to spoil. In fact, archaeologists found vestiges of preserved honey in 2000 year old earthenware pots, from excavated sites. A major part of the honey may have been absorbed into the earthenware with the passage of time, but there was still some left over from those days millenniums ago, when people were preserving honey and putting them into usage. As far as the natural and curative properties of honey goes, the fact is indisputable that this product has been used as a cure-all for diseases for centuries in Mesopotamian, Russian, Native American, Aztec, South American, Indian, Chinese, Egyptian, Greek and other ancient medical sciences. In fact, ask any wise man or shaman or herbalist who is well versed in ancient herbal lore about the importance of honey in making up his medicines. And he is going to nod his head widely, and praise it and the person who discovered it, and its natural curative properties. Did you know that during the American Civil War and during WW1, when doctors ran out of medicine, they asked people or the army suppliers to supply them with honey? This was then placed on the open wounds, so that the infection could be cured or prevented. It is strange to see that the West has forgotten the use of honey as a natural healer. This book is going to tell you all about the use of honey and its benefits in curing various ailments. The author is going to try her best to use commonly obtained ingredients easily available in your nearby market, garden or kitchen itself. Remember that if any remedy calls for warming up the medicine before use, do not heat honey to boiling point. This destroys all its curative properties. Just warm it mildly, for a couple of seconds, and that is going to be enough for the honey&#x2019;s power to incorporate it in the ingredients to make Powerful Heal All. Also, you may find that some of the remedies and recipes ask you to take some precautions when you are eating a medicine made up of honey. This can be as simple as not eating spicy and fatty food. You may be also asked not to eat meat. Honey is without a doubt the best guardian of your health naturally. Ask all those people who have been using honey as a part of their natural diet every day. So if you suffer from any sort of disease, and want to look at the best way in which you can cure it naturally, all you have to do is browse through this book and find how honey is going to protect your health right now.</p><p></p><h2>In My Other Life: Stories</h2><p>A hip New Yorker confronts the accident of middle age.</p><p>The inhabitants of <i>In My Other Life</i>--bartenders and waitresses, drug counselors, teachers, many with histories of narcotics use or minor criminality--come to engaging life in Joan Silber's serene, understated prose. She renders even the few fantastic occurrences in her first short-story collection in simple, serviceable phrases, like aluminum cutlery--not the stuff you'd bring out for company, but the battered, durable everyday kind. That Silber can sometimes make a kite or a suspension bridge out of knives and forks is one reason for reading these stories, which in other ways may sound like old <i>New Yorker</i> fiction: short on incident, long on tranquil recollection. In "Without Ellie," a young woman remembers the night that she failed to save the life of her mentally disturbed stepsister, who broke away from her on a Manhattan street one night and was later found beaten and stabbed. In "Partners," a Florida travel agent receives a phone call in the wake of Hurricane Andrew from her old friend and business partner, for many years a drug runner and shady character. Rae tells Nathan about her sojourn in the basement during the hurricane, and, from the safety of middle age, recalls the "tremendous things" they had undergone in their youths: a failed drug buy in La Paz, the new gun that made Nathan "silky and confident." <blockquote> In fact, they had worn her out, those exciting troubles. She was weather-beaten when they were over. But down in the laundry cellar, with the pipes shaking, she was just as glad to be weather-beaten. All the disasters of her life (and Nathan was far from the worst) seemed reassuring, the grislier the better, she was glad to have them to remember. The trouble stored in her was like a white noise, another roar, to whatever was outside.</blockquote> At their most oblique, Silber's stories can read like the rambling monologues of transients in bus terminals--the book's opener, "Bobby Jackson," has a climax so soft that it's easy to miss--but at their best, they are shrewd and revelatory, well worth reading twice. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Silber&#39;s prose has all the traits of an urban sensibility: confidence, wit, individual style, and an emotional distance that keeps the despair of city life in perspective. Her characters often face risks that astonish themselves, a lesbian couple adopts a biracial baby, an ex-stripper thinks about a life without sex. These characters are what Hopkins called widows of an insight lost--they know that each era has its own assumptions and they&#39;re never enough; real life is always trickier and vaster. Narrated with abiding calm, Silber&#39;s people encounter the surprise of the particular, ready or not.</p><h2>Polar Bears</h2><p>The polar bear is the biggest and most powerful of the animals that are able to survive the hostile climate of the Arctic. Cubs are born during the cold dark winter, even though they start out with only a thin coat of fur and weigh a little over one pound. The mothers raise and teach them so they may grow and survive in the wild. Here is information about how polar bears swim and hunt, how they keep warm and dry, and the many other ways they adapt to their environment.</p><p>Gail Gibbons &#34;has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children&#39;s writer-illustrator,&#34; according to the Washington Post. Winner of the 2010 Regina Award, she has written and illustrated more than fifty books for Holiday House. She lives in Corinth, Vermont.Gr. 2-4, younger for reading aloud. Gibbons follows her trademark format of colored sketches and simple, informative text in this solid introduction to polar bears. An introductory spread about the polar region includes a map and examples of the few other animals that live there. Gibbons goes on to describe the bear's body size and features, including interesting facts such as why the bears have no eyelashes (they would collect ice). Explanations of the bear's life cycle pair with cozy pictures of the mother bear in her snug den nursing her cubs. Warnings about environmental hazards affecting the bears and a "Paw Prints" section of fast facts conclude. Written in brief, engaging sentences with facts that inform but don't overwhelm, this is a good selection for beginning report writers; it will also work well as nonfiction read-aloud for young ones. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

This title stands out among the flurry of books published in the past few years, both for the quality of its activities and the inclusion of folktales that can be used within a study of Islam or as stand-alone stories for units on many different topics.<br><i>Coop Renner, Fairmeadows Elementary, Duncanville, TX</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Blessed Teresa of Calcutta: Missionary of Charity (Encounter the Saints Series, 17)</h2><p>Profiles Mother Teresa of Calcutta, the Yugoslavian nun who became a missionary to India, dedicated her life to serving the poorest of the poor, and founded the Missionaries of Charity, a congregation of Roman Catholic sisters who carry on her work.</p><p></p><h2>Don&#39;t Mind Me: And Other Jewish Lies</h2><p>We all tell lies.<p>But Jewish lies are a little bit different.</p><p>Here's an example:</p><p><em>It doesn't matter if you read this.</em></p><p>The Jewish people speak many languages.

In America, L�ger found much to admire--above all, a dynamic embrace of industry sympathetic to his own quasi-Futurist love of technological energies. An early critic of L�ger described him as more of a "Tubist" than a Cubist, noting the cool metal cylinders that fill his early work. It was through such motifs that the artist approached modern life, viewing industry as a force for the good and its translation into art as a Modern vernacular. "Our pictures are our slang," he optimistically declared towards the end of his stay in New York. During that time, L�ger had produced some of his most important works, which found a ready audience in the younger American artists surrounding him. <i>Paris-New York</i> covers the artist's entire oeuvre, from the Cubist-influenced early work to the later, cheerful large-format paintings. Special attention is paid to the American dimension of L�ger's oeuvre, and the volume traces his impact on American artists--primarily on Roy Lichtenstein and Ellsworth Kelly, but also on other late twentieth-century artists such as Robert Rauschenberg, Al Held, Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist, Frank Stella and Andy Warhol.</p><p></p><h2>Russian Cuisine - 130 Recipies</h2><p>M.:&#34;Ivan Fedorov&#34;, 2000, 136 p., soft cover, illustrated, large format, in English (&#34;Russian classics&#34;).

As those in power around the globe face up to the challenges of a new world order, in Washington CIA Deputy Director Jack Ryan is putting everything into a plan that could finally bring peace to a Middle East still suffering from the ravages of war. But too many groups have invested too much blood to allow the plan to succeed -- the terrorists have one final desperate card to play. With one terrible act the world is plunged into nuclear crisis. His dreams of peace shattered, Ryan is confronted with a situation he has never dared to imagine: with the world standing on the brink of war, what do you do if the US President is incompetent to deal with the greatest crisis of all?</p><p>Once again, Tom Clancy manages to add new twists to the alternate U.S. history he initiated in <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>. In <i>The Sum of All Fears</i>, the center of conflict is the perpetual hot spot the Mideast, where a nuclear weapon falls into the hands of terrorists just as peace seems possible. Clancy realistically paints an almost unthinkable scenario--the bomb is planted on American soil in the midst of an escalation in tension with the Soviet Union; the terrorists hope to rekindle cold war animosity and prevent reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians.<p> Despite such a dramatic story line, Clancy doesn't neglect the individuals who drive his tale. Jack Ryan's problems are as much domestic as they are part of the international crisis that is the ostensible narrative: National Security Director Elizabeth Elliot has the president's ear, and she has convinced him that Ryan's ethics are questionable. She hints at marital infidelity and an insider-trading scandal. Of course, both accusations are false, but her arguments have enough evidence behind them (e.g. some photographs of an innocent embrace with a friend) to cause a strain in the Ryans' marriage and a flurry of media attention. While "Mr. Clark" tracks the terrorists, he also provides some needed intelligence to heal the Ryan family. </p><p> <i>The Sum of All Fears</i> is the stuff of nightmares but contains enough verisimilitude to terrify sober minds. Ryan has matured into a complex protagonist as Clancy's writing, too, has matured. Ryan is plagued by stress and self-doubts that test even his dauntless moral compass and make him a more interesting subject for readers' attention. Those fascinated by military hardware, from nuclear submarines to atomic weapons, will find almost enough here to start their own army. And Clancy's understanding of international politics seems chillingly correct. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>A new world order... on the brink of destruction... Peace may finally be at hand in the Middle East---as Jack Ryan lays the groundwork for a plan that could end centuries of conflict. But ruthless terrorists have a final, desperate card to play; with one terrible act, distrust mounts, forces collide, and the floundering U.S. president seems unable to cope with the crisis. With the world on the verge of nuclear disaster, Ryan must frantically seek a solution---before the chiefs of state lose control of themselves and the world. The author of five consecutive #1 bestsellers, Tom Clancy now offers his timeliest, most explosive novel yet, presented here in a special, expanded four-cassette program---six hours of the exceptional realism, authenticity and unrelenting suspense that make him the undisputed master of the contemporary thriller.</p><h2>Kingdom Principles Of Financial Increase</h2><p>You don&#39;t have to live in financial bondage any longer!

If we have Internet access, any one of us can publish almost anything we like and potentially reach an audience of millions. Never was there a time when the evils of unlimited speech flowed so easily across frontiers: violent intimidation, gross violations of privacy, tidal waves of abuse. A pastor burns a Koran in Florida and UN officials die in Afghanistan.<br> &nbsp;<br> Drawing on a lifetime of writing about dictatorships and dissidents, Timothy Garton Ash argues that in this connected world that he calls cosmopolis, the way to combine freedom and diversity is to have more but also better free speech. Across all cultural divides we must strive to agree on how we disagree. He draws on a thirteen-language global online project&#x2014;freespeechdebate.com&#x2014;conducted out of Oxford University and devoted to doing just that. With vivid examples, from his personal experience of China's Orwellian censorship apparatus to the controversy around Charlie Hebdo to a very English court case involving food writer Nigella Lawson, he proposes a framework for <i>civilized</i> conflict in a world where we are all becoming neighbors.</p><p><b>You're best known for your writing on political events around the world, especially in places undergoing turmoil.&nbsp;How does your interest in free speech relate to your past work?</b> <br> Free speech is a pivotal issue for world politics. It will be crucial for the political evolution of China and hence its relations with the West. It will decide whether a Europe transformed by immigration from majority Muslim countries can combine diversity and freedom. Its absence is both symptom and cause of the parlous condition of the Middle East, not to mention Putin's Russia. <br> &nbsp; <br> <b>How do you view the United States' role in the global struggle over free speech?</b> <br> The modern First Amendment tradition makes the US the most powerfully pro-free-speech country in the world. But emerging powers such as India and Brazil are not ready simply to copy it. I argue that the US has to rethink the way it talks about free speech to the world. And it has to practice at home what it preaches abroad, from net neutrality to respecting the privacy of people's e-mail. <br> &nbsp; <br> <b>Are we&nbsp;more free to write and say what we think than in the past, or less?</b> <br> Obviously, much depends on who you are, and where. Each age has its own challenges. Three of the biggest threats to free speech today are violent intimidation by Islamists&nbsp; <i>sans fronti�res</i>, the model of &#x201c;information sovereignty&#x201d; promoted by China, and the way money howls through American politics.<b>Timothy Garton Ash</b> is Isaiah Berlin Professorial Fellow at St. Antony&#x2019;s College, University of Oxford; Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University; and a regular contributor to the <i>New York Review of Books.</i> He is the winner of the 2017 Charlemagne Prize and has won the Orwell Prize for Journalism.</p><h2>Hiero&#39;s journey (Bantam Science Fiction)</h2><p>Per Hiero Desteen was a priest, a telepath -- and a highly trained killer.

Jiles, an American who went to Canada with her draft-avoiding lover in the 60's and stayed on to teach in the Arctic and write poetry, returns to Missouri in the late 1980's to bury her mother. There, at a horse-trading jamboree in the Ozark hills, she meets Jim Johnson, a Texan and retired colonel, a man ``full of experiences I've never had as well as information and data and books on military history I've never read.'' Attracted to each other, the two are nevertheless wary of commitment: Johnson, unhappy in a second marriage, still mourns his beloved first wife; Jiles, who has lived the life of a freedom-loving literary bohemian, is reluctant to settle down. They have serious political differences as well--Jim fought in Vietnam, Jiles was against the war. Curious about her Missouri cousins and the role of her father and grandfather in their lives, Jiles uses her questions about her family as a way for the two to get better acquainted. With an advance from her publisher, she and Johnson travel in a trailer around the South, catching up with family and history and finding true love as well. And love, Jiles learns, turns out to be just as good for older and perhaps wiser lovers. The family stories, however revealing of clan legends and loyalties, are secondary to the evolving love story, told with disarming candor and good humor. A heartwarming but refreshingly unsentimental account. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This is the result of award-wining poet/writer Jiles's seven-month quest to find and interview her cousins, scattered throughout southeast Missouri, the Midwest, and the South, and to rediscover her dead father through her family's memories. Jiles presents her cousins' unadorned narratives, punctuating them with descriptions of her volatile relationship with her traveling companion and lover, Jim Johnson, who is fleeing a messy divorce. The cumulative effect is of being privy to the emergence of a family's mythology. By the book's end, the interviews have merged into a portrait of an American family, a portrait at times superficial but always real, immediate, and true. One might wish for more psychological depth and longer, more probing interviews, or for more of Jiles's own analysis, but the book ultimately succeeds on its own terms.

Sixty-seven shots were fired. One nation watched . . . <br><br> On May 4, 1970, Ohio's Kent State University was in chaos following President Richard Nixon's announcement that the U.S. bombing of Cambodia would continue, with student protesters on one side and the National Guard on the other. That day, young Chicago Tribune reporter Philip Caputo had been sent to the campus to cover what looked like just another student uprising. But by the time he arrived, things had erupted into one of the watershed moments of the antiwar movement, with four students dead and nine wounded in a hail of bullets fired by panicked guardsmen. Now, thirty-five years later, the author of <i>A Rumor of War</i> looks back on that terrible day, discussing his own emotions, the nature of political discourse and civil disobedience, and what happened to those who were there and how they still live with the pain and anger every day. It was a time when America turned upon itself and our nation's innocence was lost.</p><p>Philip Caputo, author of the classic Vietnam memoir <i>A Rumor of War</i>, returns to the turbulent era of the late 1960s with <i>13 Seconds: A Look Back at the Kent State Shootings</i>. Caputo carefully sets the stage for the tragedy--the gunning-down of students on the Kent State, Ohio, campus--as he shows the pressures slowly building: Richard Nixon's decision to invade Cambodia, the militaristic missives of the ultra-leftist Weathermen, and statements such as high-profile California governor Ronald Reagan's declaration about student protests, given three weeks before the shootings ("If it takes a bloodbath, let's get it over with"). <p> While important events surge and roil throughout the book like massive currents, Caputo focuses primarily on the smaller stories of the students injured and killed by National Guard bullets. Caputo, a journalist then writing for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> (and who went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1972), was on the scene soon after the shootings took place. He writes with immediacy, clearly drawn back to the moment even after 35 years have passed. Some of the students who died that day were active in campus politics, while others were caught purely by misfortune, but all paid an incredible price. By allowing readers to understand more about the students and the circumstances that surrounded May 4, 1970, Caputo turns the story of Kent State into a kind of tragic novel. The book itself is short: under 200 pages, including summaries of court testimonies that make up the bulk of the index. But the poignancy of what America lost that day comes through clearly in Caputo's dense, no-nonsense writing. <i>--Jennifer Buckendorff</i></p><p>Philip Caputo is the author of the <b>New York Times</b> bestseller <b>A Rumor of War</b> and numerous novels.

It also features an interview with Acker.</p><p>Novelist, prose stylist and feminist writer Kathy Acker was born 1947 in Manhattan and died 1997 in Tijuana, Mexico. Acker&#39;s first work appeared in print as part of the burgeoning New York literary establishment, only being published by small presses until the mid-1980s, thus earning herself the epithet of literary terrorist. In her work, she combined plagiarism, cut-up techniques, pornography, autobiography, persona and personal essay to confound expectations of what fiction should be. Her highly innovative and highly acclaimed books include Blood and Guts in High School, Don Quixote, Empire of the Senseless, In Memoriam to Identity, Pussy and Eurydice in the Underworld, which was published by Arcadia in 1997.&#34;Acker gives her work the power to mirror the reader&#39;s soul&#34; - William S. Burroughs&#34;Kathy Acker&#39;s writing is virtuoso, maddening, crazy, so sexy, so painful, and beaten out of a wild heart that nothing can tame. Acker is a landmark writer&#34; - Jeanette Winterson</p><h2>Dead Men&#39;s Secrets: Tantalising Hints of a Lost Super Race</h2><p>REVISED EDITION: Archaelogist Jonathan Gray stumbled upon something that shocked him!...a whole cache of &#34;out of place&#34; items that should not exist.

How does her devoted mother emerge from the shock of finding that her daughter has not only disappeared but had been living a secret life for more than a year? </p><p> Mother and daughter tell their parallel stories in mesmerizing first&#x2013;person accounts. Claire Fontaine's story is a parent's worst nightmare, a cautionary tale chronicling her daughter Mia's drug&#x2013;fueled manipulation of everyone around her as she sought refuge in the seedy underworld of felons and heroin addicts, the painful childhood secrets that led up to it, and the healing that followed. Her search for Mia was brutal for both mother and daughter, a dizzying series of dead ends, incredible coincidences and, at times, miracles. Ultimately, Mia was forced into harsh&#x2013;but&#x2013;loving boot camp schools on two continents while Claire entered a painful but life&#x2013;changing program of her own. Mia's story includes the jarring culture shock of the extreme and controversial behavior modification school she was in for nearly two years, which helped her overcome depression and self&#x2013;hatred to emerge a powerful young woman with self&#x2013;esteem and courage. </p><p> Come Back is an unforgettable story of love and transformation that will resonate with mothers and daughters everywhere.</p></p><p><p>Claire Fontaine and Mia Fontaine are the coauthors of the bestselling memoir <em>Come Back: A Mother and Daughter's Journey Through Hell and Back</em>.</p><p>A former screenwriter, Claire divides her time between the United States and Europe, where she is researching a historical novel and doing a comparative analysis of <em>les �clairs au chocolat de Paris</em>. She is also a certified relationship coach and a certified life coach. </p><p>A popular motivational speaker, Mia has written for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Huffington Post</em>, <em>Ms.</em> magazine, and Atlantic Online, and is currently at work on a narrative nonfiction book that combines four of her greatest interests: travel, human behavior, history, and culture. She lives in New York City. </p>A nightmarish saga of a teenage runaway in L.A. ends triumphantly thanks to love and support from her screenwriter mom and stepdad. At 15, Mia gets involved in a dangerous drug and Wicca scene, stunning her successful, controlling mother, Claire, and stepfather, Paul. But the signs were in place earlier, after Mia's history of being sexually abused by her biological father, a violent, vindictive drug user whom Claire left with difficulty. Sent to Indiana to live with Claire's sister, Mia starts using cocaine heavily and even gets arrested. When the destructive behavior (including self-mutilation) accelerates, Claire and Paul send Mia to the unlikely Morava Academy, in the Czech Republic, a kind of Spartan military institution where 50 teens are rigorously monitored and reprogrammed. Meanwhile, back in L.A., the parents undergo an intensive group therapy called Discovery to learn to shed guilt for their daughter's behavior, and also forgive her. Oddly, Morava is soon shut down after allegations of staff abuse, but Mia goes through a brilliant turnaround at Spring Creek Lodge in Montana. Mia's desperate diary entries appear between Claire's lively, angry, sarcastic narrative, allowing mother and daughter to maintain a heart-wrenching, honest dialogue. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

However, the chapter titles do not always provide enough clues as to the complete scope of the section. The subheadings that divide the material into short, manageable segments are more helpful. Readers may need to skim each chapter spread, noting the subheading, to locate needed information. The pages are full of colorful photographs, illustrations, time lines, artwork, and diagrams complete with well-written captions. The texts offer more information than textbooks, but still do not delve deeply enough into each civilization to provide information for more than a simple report. However, the visual artifacts from each civilization are sure to interest students. None of the books includes a bibliography.

Basic techniques are explored, such as scratching on an ink-blacked surface and applying ink or acrylics on a white clay surface. Other methods are reviewed: airbrush, gouache, watercolor, oils, tempera, and colored pencils.<br>&#x201c;Artists looking for new ways of interpreting their work will be pleased to find this on library shelves.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i>, July 2001</p><p>Colorado painter, printmaker, and educator Charles Ewing explores art on clay surfaces in <i>The New Scratchboard</i>. Unfired porcelain clay applied in a thin layer to a support gives a surface that is both absorbent and easily scratched. Images are created by applying and removing pigment. Ewing looks at the long history of clay-surface art and describes the nature of clay-coated surfaces. He presents a staggeringly wide range of pigment that media artists can employ on scratchboards, including graphite, colored pencils, charcoal, ink pens, watercolor, acrylic, gouache, oil, etc. Application and removal tools are equally diverse. Chapters about using India ink and color on white clay surfaces include demonstrations and exercises, and Ewing also provides extensive demonstrations of printmaking techniques such as relief, intaglio, and lithography. The book is exhaustively illustrated by a wide range of artists who have exploited the easy versatility the clay surface affords. Ewing's own work portraying horses and animals from the wild on inkboard reflects a mastery of line, form, and rhythm; his black-and-white rendition of four dancing ravens, for example, is simultaneously amusing and realistic. Any artist is sure to find a captivating technique from the wide media illustrated, each with its own unique characteristics. Although saturated with technique, the book celebrates experimentation, which is perhaps best captured in its being "dedicated to those with a 'What if...' curiosity that always prevents them from exactly following a recipe." <i>--Mary Ribesky</i><b>Charles Ewing</b>, the developer of the porcelain clay surface trademarked as &#x201c;Clayboard,&#x201d; exhibits work at galleries in the Southwest.

Watts</h2><p>Seen in his day as &#39;the old master in the modern man&#39;, George Frederic Watts was the most remarkable British artist of the Victorian era, the first living artist to exhibit his life work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The centenary of Watts&#39;s death is commemorated with a survey of his visionary painting, sculpture and mural designs, confronting issues of human existence, from historical pictures for the Palace of Westminster, stark scenes of social realism, mystical landscapes and mythologies, to transcendental allegories on themes of time and judgement, love and death, chaos and progress. A scholarly illustrated catalogue edited by his biographer and curator Veronica Franklin Gould, The Vision of G. F. Watts (1817- 1904) OM RA, includes essays by the senior Tate Britain curator Alison Smith on the symbolic language of his cosmic paintings, and Hilary Underwood places his painting in the context of Symbolist art in Britain and Europe.

For Elizabeth Goodweather of Full Circle Farm, still a newcomer after more than twenty years, one terrible glimpse ignites a mystery that reaches back years into these hills, drawing together dozens of seemingly unconnected lives. Elizabeth sees a frail old woman on a high porch where dolls hang by twine. When the woman jumps, and Elizabeth reacts, there is no turning back.<br><b><i><br></i></b>Nola Barrett&#x2019;s ancient, sprawling house is spewing a dark past: of depravity, scandal and murder.

But with Nola recovering from her self-inflicted wounds, Elizabeth has inherited her mad, violent drama&#x2014;while a killer has a perfect view of it all....</p><p>Vicki Lane has lived with her family on a mountain farm in North Carolina since 1975. She is at work on an addition to the saga of Elizabeth&#x2019;s Marshall County.<i>Chapter One<br>The Palimpsest<br>Friday, December 1<br></i><br>The madwoman whispered into the blue shadows of a wintry afternoon. Icy wind caught at her hair, loosing it to whip her cheeks and sting her half-closed eyes. Pushing aside the long black strands, she peered through the fragile railing of the upper porch. Below, the fieldstone walkway with its humped border of snow-hooded dark boxwoods curled about the house. Beyond the walkway the land sloped away, down to the railroad tracks and the gray river where icy foam spattered on black rocks and a perpetual roar filled the air.<br><br>Her hand clutching the flimsy balustrade and her gaze fixed on the stony path far below, the madwoman pulled herself to her feet. Behind her, a door rattled on its rusty hinges and slammed, only to creak open again.<br><br>She paused, aware of the loom of the house around her&#x2014;feeling it waiting, crouching there on its ledge above the swift-flowing river. The brown skeletons of the kudzu that draped the walls and chimneys rustled in a dry undertone, the once lush vines shriveled to a delicate netting that meshed the peeling clapboards and spider-webbed the cracked and cloudy windowpanes. From every side, in small mutterings and rustlings, the old house spoke.<br><br>None escape. None.<br><br>As the verdict throbbed in her ears, marking time with the pulse of blood, the madwoman began to feel her cautious way along the uneven planks of the second-story porch. A loose board caught at her shoe and she staggered, putting out a thin hand to the wall where missing clapboards revealed a layer of brick-printed asphalt siding, the rough material curling back at an uncovered seam. <br><br>Compelled by some urgent desire, she caught at the torn edge, tugging, peeling it from the wood beneath, ripping away the siding to expose the heart of the house&#x2014;the original structure beneath the accretions of later years.<br><br>She splayed her trembling fingers against the massive chestnut logs and squeezed her eyes shut. A palimpsest, layer hiding layer, wrong concealing wrong. If I could tear you down, board by board, log by log, would I ever discover where the evil lies . . . or where it began? Resting her forehead against the wood's immovable curve, she allowed the memories to fill her: the history of the house, the subtext of her life.<br><br>The logs have seen it all. Their story flowed into her, through her head and fingertips, as she leaned against them, breathing the dust-dry hint of fragrance. The men who felled the trees and built this house, the drovers who passed this way, the farmers, the travelers, the men who took their money, the women who lured them . . . and Belle, so much of Belle remains. Her dark spirit is in these logs, this house, this land. Why did I think that I and mine could escape?<br><br>No answer came, only the mocking echoes of memories. The thrum of blood in her ears grew louder and the madwoman turned her back on the exposed logs of the house wall to move to the railing. Leaning out, oblivious to the cutting wind, she fixed her eyes on the stony path thirty feet below. Far enough? She hesitated, looking up and down the porch. A stack of plastic milk crates, filled with black-mottled shapes, caught her eye.<br><br>Of course there would be a way. The house will see to it. Belle will see to it.<br><br>Snatching up the topmost crate, she lifted it to the porch railing. Dried and mildew-speckled, the gourds tumbled down to shatter on the stones, scattering seeds over the path and frozen ground. The madwoman set the empty crate beside the balusters and slowly, painfully, pulled herself up to stand on its red grating-like surface. Then she placed a tentative foot on the wide railing.<br>The words came to her, dredged from memory's storehouse. As always, when her own thoughts faltered, one of the poets spoke for her, one of the many whose works she had loved and learned and taught.<br><br>Balanced on the railing, the madwoman hurled the words into the wind's face.<br><br>"After great pain, a formal feeling comes&#x2014;"<br><br>She broke off, unable at first to continue, then, gathering strength, she forced her lips to form the words, speaking the closing lines into the bitter afternoon.<br><br>". . . The Snow&#x2014;<br><br>First&#x2014;Chill&#x2014;then Stupor&#x2014;then the letting go."<br><br>The house waited.<br><br><i>Chapter Two<br>Three Dolls<br>Friday, December 1<br></i><br>The three naked baby dolls, their pudgy bodies stained with age and weather, twisted and danced in the winter wind like a grisly chorus line. As the car negotiated the twisting road down to the river, Elizabeth Goodweather saw them once more. They had hung there as long as she could remember, dangling by their almost nonexistent necks from the clothesline that sagged along the back porch of the old house called Gudger's Stand.<br><br>The house lay below a curve so hairpin-sharp and a road so narrow that many travelers, intent on avoiding the deep ditch to one side and the sheer drop to the other, never noticed the house at all. It was easy to miss, seated as it was in a tangle of saplings, weedy brush, and household garbage, perched well below the level of the pavement on a narrow bank that fell away to the river.<br>I wish I'd never noticed it. It wasn't until the power company cleared some of those big trees that you could even see the house.<br><br>Her first sight of the house and its cruel row of hanged dolls had been on a fall day sixteen years back. It was Rosie's first year in high school. Sam was still alive. He was driving and our girls were in the back seat. . . .<br><br>The memory was piercing: the sudden appearance of the hitherto-unseen house with its long porches front and back; the pathetic dolls and the hunched old man sitting in a chair beneath them, belaboring their rubber bodies with his lifted cane. And a woman just disappearing into the house; I only saw the tail of her skirt as she went through the door. The whole scene was bizarre&#x2014;and unlike anything else I'd seen in Marshall County. I started to say something to Sam but then I couldn't; it just seemed too awful&#x2014;those helpless little baby dolls&#x2014;I didn't want the girls to see that old man hitting the dolls.<br><br>Ridiculous, of course. The very next time the girls had ridden their school buses, ghoulishly eager friends had pointed out the newly visible house and the trio of dangling dolls. As they downed their after-school snacks, Rosemary and Laurel had discussed the display with eager cheerfulness.<br>"Shawn says it's where old man Randall Revis lives&#x2014;and that he's had three wives and all of them have run off. So old man Revis named the dolls for his ex-wives and he whacks them with his walking stick."<br><br>Rosemary's matter-of-fact explanation, punctuated by slurps of ramen noodles, was followed by her younger sister's assertion that a girl on her bus had said the old man was a cannibal who lured children into his house and cut them up and put them in his big freezer.<br><br>"Like the witch in 'Hansel and Gretel'! And every time he eats one, he hangs up another doll!" Laurel's eyes had been wide but then she had smiled knowingly. "That's not true, is it, Mum? That girl was just trying to scare the little kids, wasn't she?"<br><br>"That's what it sounds like to me, Laurie." Elizabeth had been quick to agree, adding a tentative explanation about a sick old man, not right in the head.<br><br>But really, the girls just took it in stride as one of those inexplicable things grown-ups do. I think they even stopped seeing the house and the dolls. I wish I could have. For some reason I always have to look, and I'm always hoping that the dolls or the cords holding them will have rotted and fallen away. Or that the kudzu will have finally covered the whole place. The old man's been dead for years now; you'd think someone would have taken those dolls down.<br><br>Elizabeth shuddered and forced her thoughts back to the here and now. Sam was six years dead; their daughters were grown; it was Phillip Hawkins at the wheel of her car on this particular winter afternoon. But still the sight of the hanging dolls made her shudder.<br><br>"What's the matter, Lizabeth?" Without taking his eyes from the road, Phillip reached out to tug at her long braid. One-handed, he steered the jeep down the corkscrew road and toward the bridge over the river at Gudger's Stand. Snowplows had been out early: tarnished ridges of frozen white from the unseasonable storm of the previous night lined the road ahead.<br><br>She caught at his free hand, happy to be pulled from her uneasy reverie. "It's just that old house&#x2014;it always gives me the creeps."<br><br>Phillip turned into the deserted parking lot to the left of the road. For much of the year, the flat area at the base of the bridge swarmed with kayakers, rafters, and busloads of customers for the white-water rafting companies, but on this frigid day, it was deserted except for a pair of Canada geese, fluffed out against the cold.<br><br>"That one up there?" Phillip wheeled the jeep in a tight circle, bringing it to a stop facing away from the river and toward the house.<br><br>She nodded. "That one. It's as near to being a haunted house as anything we have around here&#x2014;folks tell all kinds of creepy stories about things that happened there in the past&#x2014;and ten years ago the old man who lived there was murdered in his bed. They've never found out who did it."<br>They sat in the still-rumbling car, gazing up the snow-covered slope to the dilapidated and abandoned house. Low-lying clouds washed the scene in grim tones of pale gray and faded brown.<br><br>"What's that?" Elizabeth leaned closer to the windshield, pointing to a dark shape that seemed to quiver behind the railings at the end of the upper porch. "Do you see it? There's something moving up there!"<br><br>"Probably just something blowing in the wind." Phillip followed her gaze. "One of those big black trash bags maybe&#x2014;"<br><br>"No, I don't think so." Elizabeth frowned, struggling to make sense of the dark form that had moved now to lean against the wall of the old house. "It's a person. But what would anyone . . . I wish I could see&#x2014;"<br><br>Phillip was already pulling out of the lot and toward the overgrown driveway that led up to the house. And even as he said "Something's not right here," the angular shape moved toward the porch railing. There was a flash of red and a tangle of rounded objects fell to the ground.<br><br>"It's a woman up there." Elizabeth craned her neck to get a better look at the figure high above them. "What's she doing . . . climbing up on something or . . . ?"<br><br>The question in her voice turned to horror. "Phillip! I think she's going to jump!"<br><br>The car was halfway up the driveway when they were halted by a downed tree lying across the overgrown ruts. High above them they could see the woman balanced on the railing. One arm around a porch pillar, she swayed in the wind.<br><br>Elizabeth shoved her door open and leaped from the car. Pulling on her jacket as she ran, she pounded up the steep drive, skidding treacherously on the frozen mud and ice-covered puddles. Behind her, she could hear the steady thud of Phillip's boots. Ahead she could see the scarecrow form of the woman, teetering on her precarious perch. Black hair writhed around her head, obscuring her face, and a long black coat lofted out in the wind, making her look like some great bird preparing for flight.<br><br>"Stop!" Elizabeth's voice was little more than a thin quaver against the wind, and she took a breath and tried again. "Please! . . . Wait! . . . Talk to us!"<br><br>This time her cry reached the woman on the railing, who turned at the sound. Her pale face stared at Elizabeth and her lips moved, but the words, if there were words, were carried away by the pitiless wind.<br><br>Elizabeth gasped. "Nola!"<br><br>She tried to run faster, even as she shouted to the figure high above her. "It's me, Nola&#x2014;Elizabeth Goodweather. Please, get down from there before&#x2014;"<br><br>The woman on the railing hesitated, wavered. Then she lifted her head as if listening to a faraway sound.<br><br>"Nola! Wait where you are, please! We'll help you . . ." Elizabeth's side was aching and her voice was a rasping croak, but she forced herself up the road and toward the old house. In the distance, a siren began its urgent howl.<br><br>Phillip was at her side now, pointing to the stairs that led to the upper porch. "Keep talking to her; I'll try to get up there."<br><br>The siren was louder now, very near.<br><br>"Nola, let us help you!" She kept moving toward the porch, laboring to be heard, to be understood, to get closer, to make eye contact with this woman she had met only a few months before. "Please, be careful; that railing looks&#x2014;"<br><br>Above her the black-haired woman slowly shook her head. Elizabeth heard the emergency vehicle turn into the drive behind her. The siren shrieked once more, then died away.<br><br>She turned to see a Marshall County sheriff's car stopped just behind her jeep. Its light was pulsing in blue rhythmic bursts as two men, followed by a smaller figure in jeans and a purple fleece jacket, emerged from its interior and began to race up the drive.<br><br>Whirling to see what effect this new arrival would have, Elizabeth was just in time to see the black-clad figure release her hold on the post, spread her arms wide, and plunge&#x2014;a great ungainly raven tumbling from the sky.<br><br>"How the hell she survived . . . if it hadn't been for one of those old boxwoods breaking her fall before she hit the stone walk . . ."<br><br>The EMTs had responded swiftly, strapping the crumpled, unconscious body of Miss Nola Barrett to a backboard and loading her into the ambulance for the trip to an Asheville emergency room. The young woman in the purple jacket had gone with Miss Barrett.<br><br>"She's the one who called us," Sheriff Mackenzie Blaine had explained. "Miss Barrett's niece or something&#x2014;been visiting her aunt. She said Miss Barrett's started acting kind of squirrelly&#x2014;obsessing about this house. Evidently the house belongs to Miss Barrett&#x2014;or she thinks it does. Anyway, the niece&#x2014;what's her name, Trace, Tracy?&#x2014;said she went to the store after lunch and when she came back, her aunt was gone. She found footprints on the trail leading down this way and was concerned that Miss Barrett might be going to . . . to hurt herself."</p><h2>Drink: The Intimate Relationship Between Women And Alcohol</h2><p><p><b>What is behind the rise in alcohol consumption and abuse among women in recent years?</b></p><p>While the feminist revolution has allowed women to close the gender gap professionally and educationally, it has also witnessed a disturbing rise in equality in more troubling areas of life. In most of the developed world, the rates of binge drinking among women have skyrocketed in the past decade. DUIs, &#x201c;drunkorexia&#x201d; and health conditions connected to alcohol abuse are all on the rise, especially among younger women&#x2014;a problem exacerbated by the alcohol industry itself. Battling for women&#x2019;s dollars and leisure time, corporations have developed marketing strategies and products targeted exclusively to women, including Girls&#x2019; Night Out, MommyJuice and Mommy&#x2019;s Time Out wines, berry-flavoured vodkas and fruit coolers.</p><p>Award-winning journalist Ann Dowsett Johnston illuminates this startling epidemic, dissects the psychological, social and financial factors that have contributed to its rise, and explores its long-lasting impact on our society and individual lives, including her own. In <i>Drink</i>, she interweaves in-depth research and interviews with leading researchers with the moving story of her own struggle with alcohol, as well as those of many other women aged seventeen to seventy. The result is an unprecedented and bold inquiry that is both informative and shocking.</p></p><p><p>One of the <em>Washington Post</em>'s Ten Best Books of 2013</p><p><em>More than twenty-three thousand women die from heavy drinking in the United States each year.</em> Incidents of binge drinking and so-called drunkorexia are on the rise, contributing to an exponential increase in the number of health conditions and cancers among women.</p><p>Combining in-depth research with her own personal story of recovery, the award-winning journalist Ann Dowsett Johnston tells of maintaining her high-powered career as a vice principal of McGill University while wrestling with the demon that defeated her own mother: alcohol addiction. After a very private exit from her professional life, Dowsett Johnston went to rehab; now sober, she has dedicated her career to examining the relationship between women and high-risk drinking.</p><p>In <em>Drink</em>, Dowsett Johnston dissects the psychological, social, and workplace factors that contribute to this crisis, and explores its far-reaching effect on both society at large and individual lives. Comprehensive and emotionally compelling, <em>Drink</em> is a brave and powerful story, beautifully told, and an important investigation into an epidemic that we can no longer afford to ignore.</p><p>The winner of five National Magazine Awards, Ann Dowsett Johnston is a writer and editor recognized for her expertise in higher education and alcohol policy. A recipient of the Atkinson Fellowship in Public Policy and a Southam Fellowship in Journalism, she spent most of her professional career at <em>Maclean's</em> magazine, where she was best known as the chief architect of the university-rankings issue.

One early experiment, the WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link), united smart, independent, left-leaning folks from all over as early as 1984, and still lives and breathes 17 years later. Journalist and long-time member Katie Hafner tells the story of its early days in <i>The Well: A Story of Love, Death and Real Life in the Seminal Online Community</i>. <p> Though the title isn't strictly accurate--there were comparatively primitive online communities long before 1984--the tale is well told and compelling. Started by visionary Stewart Brand and do-gooder Larry Brilliant, the dialup BBS offered a wide-open space for communication, developing relationships, and, inevitably, conflicts. Spicing up her story with excerpts from online posts, interviews with participants, and sometimes sordid details of WELL-being, Hafner shows that not all online communities are the same.</p><p> Though the WELL's social and business problems are legion--eventually it was bought by Salon.com--the participants and administrators consistently showed intelligence and determination, essential qualities for homesteading pioneers. Though the book can't begin to address big questions about virtual social environments (Do they help or hinder users' lives? Are they as deeply satisfying as traditional relationships? What makes them so popular?), it does help the reader begin to address them personally. That individual determination, aided by discussion with others, is the WELL's greatest legacy. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>If this slim volume about a model online community is any indication, there's no end in sight to accounts of the trailblazers of the Internet revolution, despite the recent fits in the market. Standing for Whole Earth `Lectronic Link, the Well was founded in 1984 by two visionary men: Stewart Brand and the aptly named Larry Brilliant. Brand was the legendary founder of the holistic do-it-yourself guide The Whole Earth Catalog, who contributed space in Sausalito, Calif., to the project, while Brilliant was a millionaire philanthropist who put up the software and hardware. They went online in 1985 with the idea of creating a virtual, latter-day salon rather than just another electronic bulletin board. Word of mouth spread quickly and soon the Well developed a distinctly Bay Area, post-hippie ambience that proved intensely magnetic to its members. Although membership peaked at only around 10,000, the Well's influence extended well beyond its members (another book could be written on the failed craze to build Well-like online communities throughout the Web). Hafner spices up the not-always dramatic story of the Well's business troubles with lengthy examples of the sort of literate, leftist, free-range discussions that were its bread and butter. Avoiding hyperbole, her style reflects her ease with a topic she's covered for the New York Times and in such respected books as Cyberpunk and Where Wizards Stay Up Late, though some readers may feel she skims too quickly over some dramatic stories about the love, rage and tears that the Well Beings (as they called themselves) poured into their keyboards over the years. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Someday the Rabbi Will Leave</h2><p>Rabbi Small faces political corruption, definitely non-kosher, brewed with a dash of dirty campaign tricks, blackmail, and a possible murder.

He grew up in WW II Germany, where at age 13 he was inexplicably sold by his separated parents to Circus Williams. Beginning his career as boy-of-all-work, he cleaned stables, ushered patrons, exercised horses, performed acts and was encouraged to learn every facet of the business by the circus owners who eventually gave him their name. Gebel-Williams reminisces about his favorite and least-favorite beasts (he does not like bears), but reveals little about training them. Written with freelancer Reinhold, this memoir, is emotionally flat, with fewer tales of life with animals than readers may expect. Gebel-Williams comes across as inflexible, intensely loyal, generous, obsessively proud of his family and a workaholic; modesty is not one of his virtues.

That makes them more, rather than less, impressive: Whether discussing Egon Schiele's disturbing nudes, C&#x201a;zanne's turbulent apprenticeship, Claude Lorrain's ``radiant, melancholy'' landscapes, the ``graceless, scurrilous, irreverent'' late art of Picasso, or the ideology of nationalism and hygiene shaping Vermeer's paintings, Graham-Dixon is exact and persuasive. He renders the specifics of a work of art with great precision (and, often, sympathy), and matches the specifics with short, deft passages on each artist's background, tastes, intentions, and career. He doesn't mind sharing his enthusiasms, is witty without ever seeming jaded, and can usually find a metaphor or image to nicely sum up the particular impact of a work of art. The hasty origins of the pieces sometimes intrudes; there's little room for documenting assertions. Nonetheless, this is a stimulating, often surprising debut collection. (83 photos, 4 pages color illustrations, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Graham-Dixon is touted by the voluble Robert Hughes as the "most gifted English art critic of his generation." Although the contents of this superb compilation of (mostly) exhibition reviews have previously appeared in the British daily Independent, where the author has a regular column, they are far better than most art journalism. Like Hughes, Graham-Dixon writes in an impressively learned and opinionated fashion, but he has less of a predilection for the rhetorical cri de coeur. Still, he's unafraid of expressing an unpopular view, as in daring to begin an essay on Rembrandt by calmly asserting that he was "a thoroughly inconsistent and frequently inept artist." But he fleshes out this last statement by gracefully articulating how its evident truthfulness undermines recent controversial attempts to deattribute many works previously thought to be Rembrandt's own. He's gently convincing in coming down on the side of old-style connoisseurship vs. X-ray science in evaluating creative authorship. These 53 essays are wonderful reading for any art lover and should attract a deservedly wide audience. Highly recommended.?Douglas F. Smith, Oakland P.L., Cal.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Shakespeare</h2><p>A brilliant piece of historical investigative journalism, <i>Shakespeare</i> is a fresh telling of the playwright's life based on a wide range of newly discovered sources, such as police and torture records. Rather than approaching Shakespeare as an isolated genius, Wood argues that he was very much a product of his place and time--a period of upheaval that straddled the medieval and modern worlds. It was a time of great tensions, marked by murderous plots and purges of the Elizabethan police state, from the Somerville Plot and the Essex rebellion to the Gunpowder Plot, which can now be shown to have touched Shakespeare and his family directly. If we wonder why Shakespeare was so obsessed with violence, and especially the violence of the state, there is an answer: This was Shakespeare's world.Furthermore, Wood reveals new and surprising evidence about: Shakespeare's Catholic faith, his work, and his attitudes on sex and on race. In doing so he reinstates the image of Shakespeare as a thinking artist, his work based firmly in the religion, politics, culture and class antagonisms of his day. <i>Shakespeare</i> plunges us headlong into the turbulent life and times of William Shakespeare. Presented in a beautifully designed package, with over 100 four-color and black-and-white illustrations, the result is a more convincing and complete portrait of the artist than was previously thought possible.</p><p>With <i>Shakespeare</i> Michael Wood has provided a wide-ranging summary of contemporary historical research regarding the most celebrated author in the English language. Beginning with an analysis of the roiling religious and political conflicts in Shakespeare&#x2019;s boyhood England, Wood observes that, if "great writers are made by their times, then to be born in 1564 was to be born in very interesting times indeed." For Wood, the tensions of the times generated the modern era and formed Shakespeare, one of the first modern men. <p> In addition to the investigation of the political context for Shakespeare&#x2019;s work, Wood also explores Shakespeare&#x2019;s erotic life and the genesis of his theater career. Readers learn early on that Shakespeare&#x2019;s marriage to Anne Hathaway was likely a "shotgun wedding" due to her impending pregnancy. From there, Wood speculates about the "lost years" of Shakespeare&#x2019;s life: the ten year period for which virtually no documentary evidence is extant and, unfortunately, the period that marked Shakespeare&#x2019;s departure from Avon and entry into London theatrical circles. Later, in the requisite investigation of the identity of the "Dark Lady" of the Sonnets, Wood revitalizes a theory dismissed by some scholars: that the woman was none other than Emilia Lanier, mistress of Shakespeare&#x2019;s patron. </p><p> A companion to the PBS documentary series, the book is not comprehensive of Shakespeare studies--probably no book could be. Beyond some early investigations of Shakespeare&#x2019;s Midlands dialect and some short examinations of the plays and poems, Wood provides far less close reading of the poetry and the plays than one would expect. But the book does provide a broad historical understanding of Shakespeare&#x2019;s world and a flavor for his daily life. The volume is also complemented by lavish illustrations, detailed maps, and period artwork. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p><b>Michael Wood</b> is an acclaimed author and TV presenter.

Bierut is widely considered the finest observer on design writing today. Covering topics as diverse as Twyla Tharp and ITC Garamond, Bierut's intelligent and accessible texts pull design culture into crisp focus. He touches on classics, like Massimo Vignelli and the cover of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, as well as newcomers, like <i>McSweeney's Quarterly Concern</i> and color-coded terrorism alert levels. Along the way Nabakov's <i>Pale Fire</i>; Eero Saarinen; the paper clip; Celebration, Florida; the planet Saturn; the ClearRx pill bottle; and paper architecture all fall under his pen. His experience as a design practitioner informs his writing and gives it truth. In <i>Seventy-nine Short Essays on Design</i>, designers and nondesigners alike can share and revel in his insights.</p><p>Michael Bierut is a partner at Pentagram and a 2006 AIGA medalist. He is a design critic for the online journal Design Observer, the Public Radio International program Studio 360, and the Yale School of Art.Bierut is a writer who balances equal dose of optimism and skepticism to draw readers in and let them find their own way out. Each of the 79 essays is printed in a different typeface, and though a reader could probably do without Bulmer and Danubia, reading the changing text is part of the enjoyable adventure as Bierut looks at ordinary circumstances of design that have the ability to create extraordinary consequences in life. -- <i>Communication Arts, August 2007</i><br><br>Highbrow and brilliant. -- <i>New York Magazine, The Approval Matrix, August 2007</i><br><br>I was rewarded every time I dipped into this elegant, thoughtful compilation of stand-alone essays. -- <i>Adage, November 2007</i><br><br>In this lively collection of previously published essays, Michael Bierut provides a compulsively readable guide to all things design. While fonts and logos receive their expected due, so too do Eero Saarinen's TWA terminal, treadmill tripping, and enormous wild geese. -- <i>Dwell, January 2008</i><br><br>Topics range from design-related discourses on how to become famous or deal with a client to art, economics, history, war, politics and books. Even the redesigned Food Pyramid gets a section. Regardless of the topic, Bierut's sometimes-bemused voice and peircing intelligence illuminate the central role of design in our lives. -- <i>STEP Inside Design, August 2007</i><br><br>"A very well written, witty book that should find its way into any truly nerdy Dwell reader's bathroom." --Dwell Magazine</p><h2>The Other America ~ Poverty in the United States</h2><p>This powerful account draws on research by sociologists and economists to reveal the depth of the poverty crisis, analyzing why such &#34;invisible&#34; citizens as the elderly, children, and minorities are not given adequate opportunities.

Up and down the East Coast, police stations, newspapers, airports, military bases, and the Pentagon were besieged with calls from frantic citizens. One of the strange objects crash-landed on a rural hilltop in Flatwoods, WV. A group of schoolboys saw the object fall to earth. The boys and two adults headed off to look for the object and were confronted by a twelve-foot being that would become known as The Flatwoods Monster or The Braxton County Monster. The Flatwoods Monster incident and these other events all occurred in just over a 24 hour period. They have never been fully explained, and worse, they have been covered up. These UFO encounters have been hidden, ignored and discounted for more that fifty years. But now, author Frank Feschino reveals the shocking truth about these events.</p><p>Frank C. Feschino Jr. grew up in Connecticut. He attended the Paier School of Art in Hamden, Connecticut. There he studied illustration, commercial art and photography. Frank excelled in painting and was trained by several world-renowned artists including Kenneth Davies and Rudolph Zallinger. He graduated in 1981 with a Fine Arts degree in Illustration. After college Frank worked in his family s business and then as a graphic artist. In 1990, on a visit to a cousin s farm in Braxton County, he discovered that UFO sightings were fairly common in the region. Frank began to document the anomalies. When he learned about the Flatwoods Monster incident, he began an arduous and fascinating journey to discover the truth about this mystery. Frank spent fourteen years researching, writing, and illustrating The Braxton County Monster: The Cover-up of the Flatwoods Monster Revealed. During this time he also studied film and video production at Phillips Jr. College in Florida. In this project he was able to combine his camera, interviewing and artistic skills. In The Braxton County Monster, Frank passion for the case has revealed an amazing mystery.</p><h2>Thunder Horse</h2><p>When a dead snowmobiler carrying a large fossil tooth is found in rural Montana, it sets off a deadly race to find a potentially valuable Tyrannosaurus Rex dinosaur skeleton that may lie in an ancient burial ground.</p><p>Fans of Peter Bowen's gloriously unbridled books about Montana's Gabriel Du Pre have cause to celebrate with <i>Thunder Horse</i>. The part-Medis Indian cattle-brand inspector and occasional deputy sheriff gets involved in a story of murder and greed that links the ancient Indian residents of Montana (and an even older inhabitant, Tyrannosaurus Rex--the titular "thunder horse") with a present-day Japanese consortium's plans to turn a bucolic spring into a commercial trout farm. Along the way, Du Pre drives his old pickup too fast along Montana's back roads, drinks gallons of cheap wine with a brace of fascinating friends, plays his fiddle, and resonates with originality and energy. Past Du Pre tales in paperback include <i>Notches</i>, <i>Specimen Song</i>, and <i>Wolf, No Wolf</i>.Praise for <i>Thunder Horse</i>:<p> "Strange, seductive...guaranteed to draw you to the campfire." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p> "The growing crowds of fans of Peter Bowen's gloriously unbridled books about Montana's Gabriel Du Pre have new cause to celebrate...Du Pre...resonate[s] with originality and energy." --<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p> "The Gabe Du Pre books stand alone among other crime series set in the West--a unique and completely involving reading experience...A special book in a special series." -<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</p></p><h2>Travel Writing (Lonely Planet)</h2><p>Bursting with invaluable advice, this inspiring and practical guide is a must for anyone who has ever yearned to turn their travels into saleable tales.

Still, his streak shooting can be dazzling, and many of his best games have come before a network television audience. This is Reggie's diary kept during the 1994^-95 season. Don't expect the book to generate any scandalous headlines; despite his trash-talkin', hot-dog image, Reggie in print turns out to be an intelligent young man whose opinions rarely extend beyond common knowledge. For example, he refers to the Knicks as a dirty team and says their star guard, John Starks, has a hollow little head. These are not revelations to NBA fans. He does provide a good sense of the NBA season's interminable length and touches on the delicate chemistry that must be established on a winning team. On balance, this is a lightweight, sanitized look at the NBA, but Miller's name will attract some attention, especially from Pacer fans. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i>Miller, star of basketball's Indiana Pacers, and coauthor Wojciechowski have produced a run-of-the-mill chronology of the 1994-95 National Basketball Association season as seen through Miller's eyes. Miller, who is perhaps best known as the player who got in a "woofing" contest with director Spike Lee during the 1993-94 playoffs, does not come across as the egotistical, loud-mouthed person he often appears to be but instead reveals himself to be a shy young man with a loving, supportive family. More information about Miller's life away from basketball would have made the book more interesting, however. Miller is a keen observer who has a good relationship with his coaches, teammates, and opponents, but his views and comments are a bit on the bland side. In summary, this book has little "hook" to induce readers to pick it up, except, perhaps, in the state of Indiana. A marginal purchase.?William O. Scheeren, Hempfield Area H.S.

In this incisive and wide-ranging book, Peg Birmingham explores the theoretical and social foundations of Arendt&#x2019;s philosophy on human rights. Devoting special consideration to questions and issues surrounding Arendt&#x2019;s ideas of common humanity, human responsibility, and natality, Birmingham formulates a more complex view of how these basic concepts support Arendt&#x2019;s theory of human rights. Birmingham considers Arendt&#x2019;s key philosophical works along with her literary writings, especially those on Walter Benjamin and Franz Kafka, to reveal the extent of Arendt&#x2019;s commitment to humanity even as violence, horror, and pessimism overtook Europe during World War II and its aftermath. This current and lively book makes a significant contribution to philosophy, political science, and European intellectual history.</p></p><p>A new reading of Hannah Arendt&#39;s philosophy of human rights.<p>Peg Birmingham is Professor of Philosophy at DePaul University.

In Copenhagen, veteran CIA operative Hayden Gray, determined that this sweeping story be buried, is suddenly staring down the barrel of an unexpected gun. And in Zurich, the author himself is hiding in a shadowy expat life, trying to atone for a lifetime&#x2019;s worth of lies and betrayals with publication of <i>The Accident, </i>while always looking over his shoulder.<br><br>Over the course of one long, desperate, increasingly perilous day, these lives collide as the book begins its dangerous march toward publication, toward saving or ruining careers and companies, placing everything at risk&#x2014;and everyone in mortal peril.&nbsp; The rich cast of characters&#x2014;in publishing and film, politics and espionage&#x2014;are all forced to confront the consequences of their ambitions, the schisms between their ideal selves and the people they actually became.<br><br>The action rockets around Europe and across America, with an intricate web of duplicities stretching back a quarter-century to a dark winding road in upstate New York, where the shocking truth about the accident itself is buried. <br><br>Gripping, sophisticated, layered, and impossible to put down, <i>The Accident</i> proves once again that Chris Pavone is a true master of suspense.</p></p><p><p><b>CHRIS PAVONE</b> is the author of the <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling <i>The Expats</i>, winner of the Edgar Award.&nbsp; He was a book editor for nearly two decades and lives in New York City with his family.</p>Chapter 1<br><br>It&#x2019;s just before dawn when Isabel Reed turns the final sheet of paper. Halfway down the page, her mouth falls open, her heartbeat quickens. Her eyes dart across each typescript line at a rapid-fire pace, accelerating as she moves through the final paragraph, desperate to arrive at a revelation, to confirm her suspicions. She sucks in her breath, and holds that breath, for the last lines.<br><br>Isabel stares at the final period, the little black dot of ink . . . staring . . . <br><br>She lets out her breath. &#x201c;My God.&#x201d; Astounded, at the enormity of the story. Disappointed, at the absence of the confirmation she was hoping for. Furious, at what it means. Terrified, at the dangers it presents. And, above all, heartbroken, at the immensity of the betrayal. Betrayals.<br><br>She puts the page down on the fat stack of paper that sits on the bedspread, next to a crumpled soft-pack of cigarettes and an overflowing crystal ashtray, a mildly snarky birthday present from a passive-aggressive colleague. She picks up the manuscript with both hands, flips it over, and uses her thumbs to align the pages. Her hands are trembling. She tries to steady herself with a deep breath, and sets the straightened pile of pages in her lap. There are four words centered at the top of the page:<br>The Accident by Anonymous<br>Isabel stares across the room, off into the black nothingness of the picture window on the opposite wall, its severe surface barely softened by the half-drawn shades, an aggressive void invading the cocoon of her bedroom. The room is barely lit by a small bullet-shaped reading sconce mounted over the headboard, aiming a concentrated beam of light directly at her. In the window, the light&#x2019;s reflection hovers above her face, like a tiny sun illuminating the top of her head, creating a halo. An angel. Except she&#x2019;s not.<br><br>She can feel her body tense and her jaw tighten and her shoulders contract in a spasm of rage. She tries to suppress it, bites her lip, brings herself under the flimsiest tether of control.<br><br>Isabel draws aside the bedspread, struggles to a sitting position. It&#x2019;s been hours since she has shifted her body in any appreciable way, and her legs and back are stiff and achy--old, if she had to choose a word for her joints. Her legs dangle over the side of the mattress, her toes searching for the fleece-lined slippers.<br><br>Along the wall, long slivers of aluminum shelves--hundreds of horizontal feet--are filled with neat stacks of manuscripts, their authors&#x2019; names written with thick black Sharpie into the sides of the stacks of pages. Tens of thousands of pages of proposed books of every sort, promising a wide assortment of entertainment and information, produced with a broad range of skill levels.<br><br>These days, everyone younger than Isabel seems to read manuscripts and proposals on e-readers; quite a few of those older, too. But she feels uncomfortable, unnatural, sitting there holding a little device in her hands. Isabel is of the generation that&#x2019;s just old enough to be congenitally uncomfortable with new technologies. When she started her first job, she didn&#x2019;t have a computer at her desk. A year later, she did.<br><br>Maybe next year she&#x2019;ll start using one of those things, but for now she&#x2019;s still reading on paper, turning pages, making notes with pens, surrounding herself with stacks of paper, like bricks, bunkered against the relentless onslaught of the future. And for The Accident, she didn&#x2019;t even have a choice. Because although nearly all of new projects are now delivered to her office electronically, this submission was not.<br><br>She shuffles down the hall, through the darkness. Turns on the kitchen lights, and the coffee machine--switched from AUTO-ON, which is set to start brewing an hour from now, to ON--and the small television. Filling the silent lonely apartment with humming electronic life.<br><br>Isabel had been reading frantically, hoping to discover the one assertion that rang untrue, the single mismatched thread that would unravel the whole narrative, growing increasingly discouraged as page 1 at the office in the morning became page two-hundred-something at home in the evening. She fell asleep sometime after eleven, more than halfway through, then woke again at two, unable to quiet her mind, anxious to get back to it. People in the book business are constantly claiming &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t put it down&#x201d; or &#x201c;it kept me up all night&#x201d; or &#x201c;I read it in one day.&#x201d; This time, all that was true.<br><br>So at two a.m. Isabel picked up the manuscript and started reading again, page after page, through the late-late night. Vaguely reminiscent of those days when Tommy was an infant, and she was sleep-deprived, awake in a dormant world. They are very discrete periods, for very specific reasons, when it&#x2019;s a normal part of life to be awake at four a.m.: it&#x2019;s for making babies or caring for them, in the small desperate hours when a blanket of quiet smothers the city, but through the moth-eaten holes there&#x2019;s the occasional lowing of a railroad in New Jersey, the distant Dopplered wail of an ambulance siren. Then the inevitable thump of the newspaper on the doormat, the end of the idea of night, even if it&#x2019;s still dark out.<br><br>Nothing she encountered during the 488 pages seemed false. Now she stares at the anchor&#x2019;s face on the television, tuned to Wolfe . . . That goddamned son of a bitch . . . <br><br>Her anger swells, and she loses control--<br><br>Isabel cocks her arm and hurls the remote across the kitchen, cracking and splintering against the refrigerator door, clattering loudly to the floor. Then the heightened silence of the aftermath, the subdued thrum of a double-A battery rolling across the tile, the impotent click as it comes to rest against a baseboard.<br><br>She feels tears trickling down her cheek, and wipes them away.<br><br>The coffee machine hisses and sputters the final drops, big plops falling into the tempered glass. Isabel glances at the contraption&#x2019;s clock, changing from 5:48 to 5:49, in the corner of the neatly organized counter, a study in right angles of brushed stainless steel. Isabel is a passionate proponent of perfect alignment. Fanatical, some might say.<br><br>She opens the refrigerator door, with its new scratch from the airborne remote, whose jagged pieces she kicks out of her way. She takes out the quart of skim and pours a splash into her mug. She grabs the plastic handle of the carafe and fills the mug with hot, viscous, bitter, bracing caffeination. She takes a small sip, then a larger one. She tops up the mug, and again wipes away tears.<br><br>She walks back down the now-lighted hall, lined with the family photographs she&#x2019;d unearthed when she was moving out of her matrimonial apartment, into this single-woman space in a new neighborhood, far from the painful memories of her home--of her life--downtown, where she&#x2019;d been running into too many mothers, often with their children. Women she&#x2019;d known from the playgrounds and toy stores and mommy-and-me music classes, from the gyms and grocers and coffee shops, from preschool drop-off and the pediatrician&#x2019;s waiting room. All those other little children growing older, getting bigger, Emmas and Stellas in precious little plaids, Ashers and Amoses with mops of messy curls in skinny jeans on scooters; all those self-satisfied downtown bobo parents, unabashedly proud of their progeny&#x2019;s precociousness.<br><br>She&#x2019;d bought herself a one-bedroom in a full-service uptown co-op, the type of apartment that a woman chooses when she becomes reconciled that she&#x2019;s not going to be living with another human being. She had reached that age, that stage, when a lifestyle starts to look permanent: it is what it is, and ever will be, until you die. She was making her loneliness as comfortable as possible. Palliative care.<br><br>If she wasn&#x2019;t allergic to cats, there&#x2019;d probably be a couple of them lurking around, scrutinizing her disdainfully.<br><br>Isabel lined this nice new hallway--parquet floors, ornate moldings, electrical outlets where she wants them--with framed photos. There she is, a smiling little toddler being held aloft by her tragically beautiful mother in Central Park, at the playground near the museum, a couple of blocks from the Classic 8 on Park Avenue that her parents couldn&#x2019;t actually afford. And then hand-in-hand with her remarkably unambitious father, starting fourth grade at the small-town public school in the Hudson Valley, after they&#x2019;d finally abandoned the city for their &#x201c;country place,&#x201d; the old family estate that they&#x2019;d been selling off, half-acre parcels at a time, to pay for their life. Then in cap and gown, the high school valedictorian, bound not for Harvard or Yale or even a first-rate state school, but for a second-tier--maybe third?--private college upstate, because it offered a full scholarship, including room and board, and didn&#x2019;t necessitate expensive out-of-state travel. The drive was just a few hours.<br><br>Her parents had called her Belle; still do. But once she was old enough to understand what the word meant, she couldn&#x2019;t bear to lay claim to it. She began to insist on Isabel.<br><br>Isabel had intended to go to graduate school, to continue studying American literature, eventually to teach at the university level, maybe. But that plan was formed before she&#x2019;d had an understanding of the realities of personal finance. She took what she thought would be a short-term job at a publishing house--one of her father&#x2019;s school chums was a famous editor--with the irrational expectation that she&#x2019;d be able to save money to pay for school, in a year, or two. She was buoyed by modest success in an enjoyable workplace during good business years, and one thing led to another. Plus she never saved a dime. By the time she was twenty-five, she no longer thought about grad school. Almost never.<br><br>So then there she is, in a little black dress on stage at a book-award ceremony, accepting on behalf of her author who was in South America at the time, chasing a new story. And in a big white dress, aglow, in the middle of the panoramic-lens group shot, the thirty-six-year-old bride with her bridesmaids, at her wedding to a man she&#x2019;d started dating a mere eight months earlier, short on time, perfectly willing to turn a blind eye to his obvious faults, the personality traits that her friends were too supportive to point out, until the safe remove of hindsight.<br><br>That utter bastard.<br><br>It still amazes her how quickly youth slipped away, how severely her options narrowed. Just a couple of bad relationship decisions--one guy who as it turned out was never going to commit, another who was a closeted asshole--and the infinite choices of her late twenties turned into the dwindling selection of her mid-thirties, now saying yes to any non-creepy men who asked her out at parties or introduced themselves in bars, sometimes using her middle name if the guy was on the margins of acceptability and she might end up wanting to hide behind the unstalkable shield of an alias; over the years she&#x2019;d had more than a few dates with men who thought her name was something else. Half the time, she was glad for the deception.<br><br>Another photo, a smaller print, lying in the hospital bed with Tommy in her arms, tiny and red and angry in his striped swaddling blanket and blue cap. Isabel returned to work after the standard three months, but in that quarter-year something had passed, and she was complacent to allow it. Her husband was suddenly making embarrassing amounts of money, so Isabel hired a housekeeper to go with the nanny. She started leading one of those enviable-looking lives--a four-day workweek, driving the shiny car from the pristine loft to the shingled beach house, a perfect baby and a rich handsome smart funny husband . . . <br><br>And then.<br><br>She stops at the final photo, spotlit, a small black-and-white in the center of an expanse of stark-white matting. A little boy, laughing on a rocky beach, running out of the gentle surf, wearing water wings. Isabel reaches her hand to her lips, plants a kiss on her fingers, and transfers the kiss to the little boy. As she does every morning.<br><br>Isabel continues to the bathroom, unbuttoning her flannel top as she walks, untying the drawstring of the pajama bottoms, which crumple as she releases the knot. She pushes her panties down and steps out of them, leaving a small, tight puddle of cotton on the floor.<br><br>The hot shower punishes her tense, tired shoulders. Steam billows in thick bursts, pulled out the bathroom door, spilling into the dressing area, the bedroom. The water fills her ears, drowning out any sounds of the television, of the world. If there&#x2019;s anything else in her apartment making noise, she can&#x2019;t hear it.<br><br>What exactly is she going to do with this manuscript? She shakes water out of her hair, licks her top lip, shifts her hands, her feet, her weight, standing under the stream, distracted and disarmed, distressed. It all beats down on her, the shower stream and the manuscript and the boy and the past, and the old guilt plus the new guilt, and the new earth-shattering truths, and fear for her career and maybe, now, fear for her life.<br><br>She slips into a soft, thick white bathrobe, towel-dries her hair. She sweeps her hand across the steamed-up glass, and examines her tired eyes, bagged and bloodshot, wrinkled at the corners. The bathroom&#x2019;s high-voltage lighting isn&#x2019;t doing her any favors this morning. She had long ago become accustomed to not sleeping well, for a variety of reasons. But with each passing year, it has become harder and harder to hide the physical evidence of sleeplessness.<br><br>From the other room, she can hear the irrelevant prattle of the so-called news, the piddling dramas of box-office grosses, petty marital indiscretions, celebrity substance abuse. Steam recolonizes the mirror, and she watches big thick drops of condensation streak down from the top beveled edge of the glass, cutting narrow paths of clarity through the fog, thin clear lines in which she can glimpse her reflection . . . <br><br>Something is different, and a jolt of nervous electricity shoots through her, a flash of an image, Hitchcockian terror. Something in that slim clear streak has changed. The light has shifted, there&#x2019;s now a darkness, a shadow--<br><br>But it&#x2019;s nothing, she sees, just the reflection of the bedroom TV, more footage of yesterday&#x2019;s international news, today. Today she has to consider the news in a whole new light. Now and forevermore.<br><br>She gets dressed, a sleek navy skirt suit over a crisp white blouse, low heels. The type of office attire for someone who wants to look good, without particularly caring about being fashionable. She blow-dries, brushes her shoulder-length blonde hair, applies makeup. Sets contacts into her hazel eyes. She assesses herself--tired-looking, inarguably middle-aged--in the full-length mirror, and sighs, disappointed. Three hours of sleep pushes the limit of what makeup can accomplish.</p><h2>The Awakening of Europe: Illustrated</h2><p>The Awakening of Europe by M. B.

No book has explained and disseminated this ancient art with as much power as <i>Ernest Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon</i>. Since its publication in 1932, this classic study has shaped American notions of Spain and the Spanish art of bullfighting. Preceded by the short stories and novels that firmly established Hemingway as a master of modernist fiction, <i>Death in the Afternoon</i> is Hemingway's first volume of nonfiction prose, a medium which enables him to explore his life, his art, his times, and his wide-ranging interests. <br><br>Mandel's book engages and explicates all aspects of <i>Death in the Afternoon</i>. Her introductory essay provides important historical backgrounds and contemporary facts about the various elements of bullfighting&#x2015;-the bull, the bullbreeder, the bullfighter, the bullring, and the corrida itself&#x2015;that Hemingway describes. The body of her book is devoted to detailed, definitive annotations of the several hundred persons, animals, events, and cultural artifacts that Hemingway included in his wide-ranging book. These alphabetically-arranged entries reveal Hemingway's views on painting, sculpture, architecture, sports, politics, economics, travel, music, food, drink, sex, language, and literature. Comprehensive endnotes, a multi-lingual bibliography, attractive illustrations, and an index complete the encyclopedic volume. It is an essential companion for all readers and teachers of Hemingway.</p><p><b>Miriam B.

Both oversights would be a mistake. (<i>Languages and Literature</i>)<br><br>...this ambitious and comprehensive volume helps explain one of the key enigmas of modern literature-Hemingway's unique style....Mandel's annotations will help us comprehend the depth of Hemingway's knowledge of art and politics, of life and style, of history and tauromachy. Even diehard aficionados will learn more than they might care to admit they didn't already know, thanks to Mandel's indefatigable research...Ambitious; relentlessly thorough; scholarly in the best and broadest sense; punctilious; extremely useful, no matter how many taurine merit badges you have; politically fearless and astute...; historically and geographically savvy; linguistically sophisticated-the work is virtually faultless....There is so much positive and positively useful material here that one must cheer for a job well done. (<i>North Dakota Quarterly, Fall 2003</i>)<br><br>Hemingway is a minimalist, full of allusions.

His chronicle of his experiences is a top-flight view of police work at the street level, where an officer's death is an ever-present possibility and physical battles with suspects are frequent. Middleton's anecdotal history is grouped into subjects such as heroism, the ``us against them'' police mentality, drugs, gangs and deadly force. He is optimistic about certain aspects of the LAPD, reporting that many of the racist and sexist officers have retired; but he ends on an exceedingly pessimistic note, opining that the 1992 post-Rodney King verdict riots showed that there have been no vast changes in L.A. ghetto life. Middleton provides one of the most dramatic depictions of gritty police work in memory. <p></p><p>Copyright 1994 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Family Walk Again: Family, Friends, Self-Esteem, and 49 Other Weekly Readings for Your Family Devotions</h2><p>In this compilation of daily Bible studies, families can learn what the Bible has to say about issues facing them today.</p><p></p><h2>Williams-Sonoma: Salad: Food Made Fast</h2><p>A collection of illustrated cookbooks for the busy home cook utilizes a straightforward approach to preparing tasty, healthful, and time-saving dishes for every night of the week, with easy-to-follow recipes and tips on keeping a well-stocked pantry, planning ahead, and using fresh ingredients.</p><p>Brigit Binns began her culinary education during a 10-year residence in Europe and has authored more than 14 cookbooks including Williams-Sonoma Sauces, Breakfasts, Hors d&#39;Oeuvres, and Complete Grilling.

In area it was the biggest of the dominions and Condelor, its beautiful and ancient capital, was the most elegant of the known world's cities. The buildings that lined its streets were built proof against age as well as earthquakes, built with curving walls that tapered gracefully upward, as if striving to rise into the air. The windows were within heavy arches, but there were so many windows in each building that their interiors were never dark or oppressive. The apartment terraces, shops, and storehouses were all encrusted with multicolored stone and glazed tiles. Even the tiles on the roofs were glazed and colored, for it was important that Condelor also be pleasing to the wardens who saw it from the air. Raised aqueducts of sawn black basalt, orange sandstone, and red brick carried water in from the nearby mountains, where it passed down terracotta pipes to power machines before emptying into the canal waterways that interwove the roads and tramways of the city.As one neared the center of Condelor the parks became bigger, the mansions were more splendid, and the streets and avenues grew wider until the royal palace came into view above the trees. It was built in parkland interlaced with canals, and to the south was the spacious palace wingfield that could accommodate the gunwings of hundreds of visiting wardens and airlords. Even the gunwing halls ofthe wingfield had stained glass in their arched windows, while the adjunct's tower was surrounded by flying buttresses and encrusted with winged gargoyles.The coronation of Greater Bartolica's new airlord had attracted wardens and squires with over three hundred sailwings and gunwings, and the field guildsmen and their tents supporting the vast flock of wings had spilled out of the wingfield area and into the surrounding parks. Ground crews could be seen pushing aircraft of every airworthy shape imaginable along the avenues to reach the guild tents where they were to be serviced, tuned, and cleaned. Freelance engineers advertised and displayed their valves, cylinders, rings, bearings, and atomizers at stalls on the mosaic sidewalks. Compression spirit of many caloric blends was available from carts laden with barrels, while other carts carried little steam engines to spin compression engines into life. Freelance gunsmiths did a particularly good trade. The best reaction guns were sold in pairs and were built light--like everything else that had to fly.Quite apart from its most obvious objective, the coronation was a celebration of travel and class distinction. In fact speed of travel defined Mounthaven society, and one's social status defined whether one had taken months or hours to reach Condelor. At the lowest levels, itinerant workers, poor scholars, outlaws, trappers, and bounty hunters traveled the trails by foot. Such travel was slow and dangerous, but free. At the next level, the farmhands, birdherders, and townsfolk never traveled more than ten miles from where they were born, but they were generally secure and happy, and never attended coronations. The merchants, artisans, and other respectable folk traveled on the steam trams, whose mesh of trackwork linked all the important cities, towns, and estates. The trams were regular and well guarded, but crowded and expensive, and averaged barely three times the pace of a brisk walk. Fuel, raw materials, and equipment were also moved by tram, which meant that everything was expensive unless produced locally. Mostestates were self-sufficient, and few cities were bigger than a half-day journey with a farm handcart.The nobility flew. Airlords, wardens, squires, and a few select guildsmen flew the sailwings, regals, and gunwings that defined the aristocracy. No part of Mounthaven was more than a few hours away from any warden's estate, but even a flock of three or four wings required an estate of two hundred to support, maintain, and fuel them. A new aircraft cost what a prosperous commoner could earn in two decades. Wardens patrolled the land during Calls, fought duels and highly stylized wars, attacked renegade militia strongholds, and monopolized fast communication and travel. The wardens were visible to all, and in turn saw, taxed, and controlled everyone beneath. them. They were also free of the Call while in the air. While in many ways less than perfect as political systems went, it had endured since the reinvention of diesel compression engines over a thousand years earlier.Serjon Feydamor was the lowest of the flying elite, an apprentice guildsman and trainee flyer. The Yarronese youth wore a plain green flight jacket as he explored the multitude of stalls of what might easily have been mistaken for an artisans' festival. On the right and left of his collar he also wore silver flyer blazons signifying that he was qualified to fly armed sailwings in the service of his airlord. He had the crest of his engineers' guild on his cap, but his cap was folded up and hidden in his pocket. Occasionally he was hailed as a squire by the vendors, and each time his heart flushed warm with pride.Serjon was in a very curious position. After having sired several daughters but no sons, the guildmaster Jeb Feydamor had petitioned his wife and his warden under the tradition of assisted succession. Under this custom, Warden Jannian visited Jeb's wife for several weeks until she became pregnant by him. Were the child another girl, the warden's youngest son would become the nominal heir of the Feydamor guild family. As it happened, Serjon wasborn of the union, yet he was born with his true father's love of flying and was proving a poor apprentice engineer. In theory, if Warden Jannian and all his other sons were to die, then Serjon could lay claim to the wardenate. Even though he never wished such a disaster to happen, Serjon nevertheless considered himself to be a flyer. The thin, angular, and intense youth of nineteen wore his engineer's crest with reluctance and shame, and only when forced to.The great gathering of aircraft was not open to the citizens of Condelor, who had to content themselves with merely watching the wings fly in from all points of the compass. Sailwings and gunwings of the Mounthaven wardens soared lazily through the sky while Serjon wandered the streets. They were elegant and stylish aircraft, whose form had often remained unchanged over centuries because their estate guildsmen had decreed that they had achieved perfection already.There were more ceremonies than just the coronation, which was the actual focus for the gathering. The guildmasters of the engineers, airframists, fuelers, gunsmiths, and instrumenteers had meetings to refine standards, while wingfield adjuncts met to discuss wingfield administration, dueling and war protocols. Members of the guild of meteorologists discussed weather theory and precedent, squires met to arrange marriages for their children, weavers debated the virtues of the new crosswoven airframe silk that promised double strength, and the wardens themselves discussed flying. The competitions were already over, but pinned to Serjon's collar at his throat was a little gold starpoint kite that marked him as the winner of the sailwing division in target kite shooting. Every so often he would caress it, as if reassuring himself that he was born to fly.Within the palace grounds the Inner Guard and ancillary carbineers all wore parade uniforms, bright, smart, and well tailored for the coronation. The instruments of the bands shone in the sunlight as they marched along theavenues playing bright, precise marches for the parades and processions, but by night string orchestras took over as the nobles and their wives, sons, and daughters danced in the brightly painted and tapestry-laden halls of the palace. An airlord from Senner had once said, "We go to Condelor to fall in love, and to remember how to live." To Serjon, however, the Condelor gathering was an excuse to hide his cap in his pocket and mingle among strangers as a flyer.Serjon's wanderings had taken him to the palace wingfield when a Calltower bell began ringing. He immediately went to a public rail and clipped his tether to it, then waited to watch the duty warden ascend for his Call patrol.&nbsp;<br>The duty warden of the palace wingfield heard the ringing of the Calltower bell as he was breakfasting in the adjunct's chambers. Even as he looked up, the guildsmen of his ground crew began shouting to each other. Moments later the compression engine of his sailwing spluttered into life as his engineers spun it with a steam engine on a cart. The warden stood up, buttoned his jacket, then took a steamed towel from his aide and wiped his face and hands. His flight jacket was a blaze of gold thread embroidery on blue and yellow silk quilting, with gilt epaulettes of dirkfang cat skulls and red gemstones inset within each button. Standing in front of a full-length mirror, he pulled on his leather and felt cap with raised domes of giltwork over the ears, laced it tight, then picked up his tassel-fringed gloves. Finally his aide brought a gold cloak with his estate's crest embroidered on the back, and Warden Brantic strode from the room out onto the wingfield.Along with Serjon there were hundreds of foreign dignitaries outside waiting to watch the warden ascend, ranging from senior wardens to mere merchants. Serjon should have felt pride burning through his body, knowing that even the wealthy merchants alongside him were below a flyer in peerage status, yet something was nagging at hismind. Warden Brantic's flight designator was 13. Serjon stared at the number as if it were a large and dangerous predator, fearful for the warden yet relieved that someone else was about to step into its cage.Most of the onlookers were in national parade dress, guild uniforms, or their own splendid flight jackets. There were so many dozens of wardens, squires, flyers, guildmasters, and envoys that Warden Brantic found the spectacle overwhelming as he emerged. What was usually a routine part of a warden's duties had become a major ceremony. One hundred and thirty wardens and nine airlords were in the city for the Bartolican Airlord's coronation, and Bartolican prestige and honor rode with every action of every official in even the most mundane of duties. The adjunct and the wingfield's herald were waiting beside the warden's sleek, white sailwing, and the onlookers included guildmasters from Dorak, Senner, and Colandoro, as well as several wardens from Yarron. All wore Call anchors or Call tethers but Brantic: for this day, he alone was to be godlike and above the Call."The layabouts are of higher rank than usual today, Sair Jiminay," said the warden quietly as the wingfield herald opened the silver clasps of the Book of Orders."A Call now means no Call for three days or more," murmured the herald. "Tomorrow morning's coronation will be free of interruption, so the new airlord can rightly claim divine favor.""Who knows, perhaps he really does have divine favor," the warden replied.The herald rang his handbell for attention."Hear now, citizens of Greater Bartolica and honored guests, that Warden Hindanal Brantic has been charged by the Airlord Designate of Greater Bartolica to oversee his palace, capital, and all its approaches during the Call that now approaches us. Warden Brantic, you are charged with the responsibility of flying high above Condelor, watching over its people's safety, guarding its approaches, and warningother wardens and flyers of the peril of the Call. Do you accept this charge?""I do accept this charge and all its responsibilities," replied Brantic.The warden pinned the Airlord Designate's pennon of arms to his jacket beside those of his wife, then strode over to his sailwing and eased himself into the seat. Like all wardens of means, he had a gunwing for dueling and a sailwing for Call patrols. The guildsmen of his ground crew removed the chocks from the wheels and aligned the aircraft on the wingstrip; then the warden was flagged clear to ascend. He tried all the flaps and control surfaces, opened the throttle, and rolled off along the rammed gravel surface. The sailwing lacked the power of a gunwing, but was lighter and more delicately built so that it could stay in the air for over four hours. The warden's sailwing ascended smoothly, and then he cranked in his wheels and banked to the north. The ordeal was over, he was up. He had not made a fool of himself in front of the assembled nobles of Mounthaven.The Call was approaching from the east, luring every mammal larger than a terrier to wander mindlessly west. The warden flew over the city walls and out over the irrigated farmlands, aqueducts, canals, and trackways. Sure enough, the birdherders were milling about against the west fences of their fields, yet their rheas, emus, and ostriches were grazing normally. The Call did not affect birds of any size; neither did it affect people if they flew free in the air. Nine miles through the Call's depth he flew over fields where its effect had passed. There were no outlaw packs hurrying along in this Call's wake to raid the capital. The warden turned back.The Call had still not reached Condelor as he flew back over its walls, but the people were prepared. The streets were almost deserted, smoke was less thick from the myriad chimneys, and only the canal barges and gravity trams were still running. The warden noted several buildings thathad not run up their flags: the owners would be fined in due course. He pressed the lever that released the sailwing's siren, then methodically patterned the city so that none but the deaf could have missed its blare.The front of the Call finally arrived, and presently Brantic was the only human awake in a strip nine miles deep and thirty miles wide. The truth was that the capital did not need the sailwings to patrol its skies during a Call. There was an adequate network of signal towers, warning stations, and Call bulwarks, so that people were seldom lost through accidents or lack of warning. The patrols were symbolic; they were to be seen rather than to protect. The sailwing was a plain statement that the nobility were above the Call in every sense of the word, as it had been for many centuries.The movement that caught Brantic's eye was within the palace grounds. A figure was walking briskly, diagonal to the Call's direction and allure. One of the ornamental birds, the warden told himself as it vanished behind a bush; then the figure was in sight again. Through his field glasses he could see arms swinging, and the bright blue of a merchant carbineer uniform. A man! The figure vanished into a doorway.The warden lowered his field glasses and rubbed his eyes. An illusion, he told himself. A shadow, a machine, a trick of the light. He hesitated, then made a note in his log. "Figure walking across direction of Call/ palace administrative wing/ ornamental rhea bird may be loose there."He was circling for another look when he noticed a gunwing over the city, approaching the palace wingfield with its wheels cranked out. Brantic pushed his sailwing's throt-de forward to full power and stood the aircraft on its wingtip as he came around to warn it off. The red double wedge grew until he could see that it was painted with the East Region's colors. He flew right across its path, but its warden ignored him."Idiot, can't you see the flags?" exclaimed Brantic aloud as he released his siren and c...</p><h2>The Expats</h2><p>Along the cobble-stoned streets of Luxembourg, mother and expat Kate Moore suspects that another American couple are not who they claim to be and as her paranoia grows, she becomes increasingly terrified that her own past is catching up with her.

When another American couple befriends them, Kate begins to peel back the layers of deception that surround her, revealing a heart-stopping con that threatens her family, her marriage, and her life.</p> <p>Sophisticated and expertly crafted, <i>The Expats</i> is set in some of Europe&#x2019;s most enchanting locales, and races toward a provocative, startling conclusion. We hope this guide will enhance your experience of the pulse-pounding journey.</p> <p><strong>Questions and Topics for Discussion</strong></p> <p>1. How does Kate&#x2019;s sense of self shift throughout the novel? In the end, how does she reconcile the roles of wife, mom, and adrenaline-seeking agent?</p> <p>2. In chapter ten, on page ninety-three, Kate thinks about crossing an unspoken line that exists in many marriages: &#x201c;You know the lines are there, you feel them: the things you don&#x2019;t discuss. . . . You go about your business, as far away from these lines as possible, pretending they&#x2019;re not there.&#x201d; To what degree did Kate and Dexter deceive themselves, as much as they deceived each other? Is complete honesty realistic for most married couples?</p> <p>3. After working hard to keep her own career a secret from Dexter, why is it hard for Kate to accept his secrecy about his job? Was she setting a double standard or just responding to her well-honed instincts?</p> <p>4. What were your initial theories about Julia and Bill, and the &#x201c;Today&#x201d; scenes?</p> <p>5. Kate was well suited to her job when she led a solitary life. What did the CIA give her in lieu of love? As she realizes that Dexter and her family are all she has, how does her understanding of love change?</p> <p>6. What is Hayden&#x2019;s role in Kate&#x2019;s life? Do you have a Hayden to rely on?</p> <p>7. How do Kate and Dexter feel about the power of breadwinners in a marriage? What does their story say about resenting a spouse who doesn&#x2019;t seem to be contributing (Dexter in America) versus resenting a spouse who seems to be a workaholic (Dexter in Luxembourg)? In the end, which of the novel&#x2019;s characters prove to be the most materialistic?</p> <p>8. Kate is haunted by the Torres episode. How did this continue to define her decision making and actions years later? If you were ever in a situation like this, how far would you go to protect your family?</p> <p>9. Dexter often cites human gullibility as a weakness in I.T. security. Discuss the characters who let their guard down for love, vanity, sex, wealth, or other lures. What ultimately makes Dexter gullible? Does his gullibility make him blameless?</p> <p>10. As the plot began to unfold, which revelations surprised you the most? What truth was buried beneath the layers of deception?</p> <p>11. <i>The Expats</i> delivers a highly realistic portrayal of female agents, motherhood, and strong women who outsmart men. What is the effect of knowing that the book was written by a man?</p> <p>12. Does it matter that the Colonel was bloodthirsty? Do the ends justify the means?</p> <p>13. What does the novel say about trust and how it is earned? What do Kate and Dexter discover about the strength of their trust for each other?</p> <p>14. Discuss the life of expatriates in general&#x2014;a role the author experienced when his wife accepted a job in Luxembourg. If you were to live abroad, where would you want to set up housekeeping? How do expats balance the fact that they&#x2019;re foreigners with the need to feel at home? Would you enjoy close-knit communities of expat spouses, or would the lack of privacy be hard to handle?</p>Chris Pavone grew up in Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell, and was an editor at book-publishing houses in New York for fifteen years.

Since then, it has been the definitive guide to American planemakers, from the earliest individuals who worked before the Revolutionary War to the last few manufacturers of the twentieth century. Now, after several years of meticulous research, a new edition of this extraordinarily influential reference book is available. The 4th edition, completely revised by Tom Elliott, reflects the tremendous amount of new information on planemakers that has come to light since the last edition. Included are: over 4000 biogrtaphical entries, over 5000 imprints, almost 2700 wedge outlines, almost 3000 individual ratings for judging relative scarcity and value. This represents twice as much informaiton as the 3rd edition and overe 4 times more information than the 1983 edition! The scope of the book is expanded by the &#34;What&#39;s a Plane Worth&#34; section, providing insights helpful in buying and selling planes, an illustrated glossary of plane terms and styles, and an extensive bibliography for further help in research. Comprehensive and up-to-date, A Guide to the Makers of American Wooden Planes IV is an absolutely essential reference for any tool collector or dealer.</p><p>Bigger and better than ever. I can think of no other work that has quite the same influence in shaping the direction and emphasis of tool collectingIa work of major importance.This book should be a constant companion for anyone interested in early American tools. -- <i><i>Maine Antique Digest</i></i></p><h2>The Crows of Pearblossom</h2><p>This title tells the story of Mr and Mrs Crow, who live in a cotton-wood tree at Pearblossom, California.

Groping in darkness, he located his underwear on the floor and took it with him into the bathroom. As quietly as he could, he closed the door before switching on the light. </p><p> Liz woke up anyway. </p><p> "Dean?" </p><p> He braced his arms on the edge of the basin and looked at his reflection in the mirror. "Be right out." His image gazed back at him, whether with despair or disgust, he couldn't quite tell. Reproach, at the very least. </p><p> He continued staring at himself for another few seconds before turning on the faucet and splashing cold water over his face. He used the toilet, pulled on his boxers, and opened the door. </p><p> Liz had turned on the nightstand lamp and was propped up on one elbow. Her pale hair was tangled. There was a smudge of mascara beneath her eye. But somehow she made deshabille look fetching. "Are you going to shower?" </p><p> He shook his head. "Not now." </p><p> "I'll wash your back." </p><p> "Thanks, but -- " </p><p> "Your front?" </p><p> He shot her a smile. "I'll take a rain check." </p><p> His trousers were draped over the armchair. When he reached for them, Liz flopped back against the heaped pillows. "You're leaving." </p><p> "Much as I'd like to stay, Liz." </p><p> "You haven't spent a full night in weeks." </p><p> "I don't like it any better than you do, but for the time being that's the way it's got to be." </p><p> "Good grief, Dean. He's sixteen." </p><p> "Right. Sixteen. If he were a baby, I'd know where he was at all times. I'd know what he was doing and who he was with. But Gavin is sixteen and licensed to drive. For a parent, that's a twenty-four-hour living nightmare." </p><p> "He probably won't even be there when you get home." </p><p> "He'd better be there," he muttered as he tucked in his shirttail. "He broke curfew last night, so I grounded him this morning. Restricted him to the house." </p><p> "For how long?" </p><p> "Until he cleans up his act." </p><p> "What if he doesn't?" </p><p> "Stay in the house?" </p><p> "Clean up his act." </p><p> That was a much weightier question. It required a more complicated answer, which he didn't have time for tonight. He pushed his feet into his shoes, then sat down on the edge of the bed and reached for her hand. "It's unfair that Gavin's behavior is dictating your future." </p><p> <i>"Our</i> future." </p><p> "Our future," he corrected softly. "It's unfair as hell. Because of him our plans have been put on indefinite hold, and that stinks." </p><p> She kissed the back of his hand as she looked up at him through her lashes. "I can't even persuade you to spend the night with me, and here I was hoping that by Christmas we'd be married." </p><p> "It could happen. The situation could improve sooner than we think." </p><p> She didn't share his optimism, and her frown said as much. "I've been patient, Dean. Haven't I?" </p><p> "You have." </p><p> "In the two years we've been together, I think I've been more than accommodating. I relocated here without a quibble. And even though it would have made more sense for us to live together, I agreed to lease this place." </p><p> She had a selective and incorrect memory. Their living together had never been an option. He wouldn't even have considered it as long as Gavin was living with him. Nor had there been any reason to quibble over her relocation to Austin. He had never suggested that she should. In fact, he would have preferred for her to remain in Houston. </p><p> Independently, Liz had made the decision to relocate when he did. When she sprang the surprise on him, he'd had to fake his happiness and conceal a vague irritation. She had imposed herself on him when the last thing he needed was an additional imposition. </p><p> But rather than opening a giant can of worms for discussion now, he conceded that she had been exceptionally patient with him and his present circumstances. </p><p> "I'm well aware of how much my situation has changed since we started dating. You didn't sign on to become involved with a single parent of a teenager. You've been more patient than I had any right to expect." </p><p> "Thank you," she said, mollified. "But my body doesn't know patience, Dean. Each month that passes means one less egg in the basket." </p><p> He smiled at the gentle reminder of her biological clock. "I acknowledge the sacrifices you've made for me. And continue to make." </p><p> "I'm willing to make more." She stroked his cheek. "Because, Dean Malloy, the hell of it is, you're worth those sacrifices." </p><p> He knew she meant it, but her sincerity did nothing to elevate his mood, and instead only increased his despondency. "Be patient a little longer, Liz. Please? Gavin is being impossible, but there are reasons for his bad behavior. Give it a little more time. Hopefully, we'll soon find a comfort zone the three of us can live within." </p><p> She made a face. "'Comfort zone'? Keep using phrases like that and, next thing you know, you'll have your own daytime TV talk show." </p><p> He grinned, glad they could conclude the serious conversation on a lighter note. "Still headed to Chicago tomorrow?" </p><p> "For three days. Closed-door meetings with folk from Copenhagen. All male. Robust, blond Viking types. Jealous?" </p><p> "Pea green." </p><p> "Will you miss me?" </p><p> "What do you think?" </p><p> "How about I leave you with something to remember me by?" </p><p> She pushed the sheet away. Naked and all but purring, lying on the rumpled bedding on which they'd already made love, Elizabeth Douglas looked more like a pampered courtesan than a vice-president of marketing for an international luxury-hotel chain. </p><p> Her figure was voluptuous, and she actually liked it. Unlike most of her contemporaries, she didn't obsess over every calorie. She considered it a workout when she had to carry her own luggage, and she never denied herself dessert. On her the curves looked good. Actually, they looked damn great. </p><p> "Tempting," he sighed. "Very. But a kiss will have to do." </p><p> She kissed him deeply, sucking his tongue into her mouth in a manner that probably would have made the Viking types snarl with envy. He was the one to end the kiss. "I've really got to go, Liz," he whispered against her lips before pulling back. "Have a safe trip." </p><p> She pulled up the sheet to cover her nudity and pasted on a smile to cover her disappointment. "I'll call you when I get there." </p><p> "You'd better." </p><p> He left, trying to make it look as if he wasn't fleeing. The air outside settled over him like a damp blanket. It even seemed to have the texture of wet wool when he inhaled it. His shirt was sticking to his back by the time he'd made the short walk to his car. He started the motor and set the air conditioner on high. The radio came on automatically. Elvis's "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" </p><p> At this hour there was virtually no traffic on the streets. Dean slowed for a yellow light and came to a full stop as the song ended. </p><p> "It's a steamy night in the hill country. Thank you for spending your time with me here on 101.3." </p><p> The smoky female voice reverberated through the interior of the car. The sound waves pressed against his chest and belly. Her voice was perfectly modulated by eight speakers that had been strategically placed by German engineers. The superior sound environment made her seem closer than if she'd been sitting in the passenger seat beside him. </p><p> "I'm going to leave you tonight with a trio of my favorites. I hope you're listening to them with someone you love. Hold each other close." </p><p> Dean gripped the steering wheel and rested his forehead on the back of his hands while the Fab Four yearned for yesterday. </p><p><br> As soon as Judge Baird Kemp retrieved his car from the Four Seasons Hotel parking valet and got in, he wrestled loose his necktie and shrugged off his jacket. "God, I'm glad that's over." </p><p> "You're the one who insisted we attend." Marian Kemp slipped off her Bruno Magli sling-backs and pulled off the diamond clip earrings, wincing as blood circulation was painfully restored to her numb earlobes. "But did you have to include us in the after party?" </p><p> "Well, it looked good for us to be among the last to leave. Very influential people were in that group." </p><p> Being a typical awards dinner, the event had run insufferably long. Following it, a cocktail party had been held in a hospitality suite, and the judge never passed up an opportunity to campaign for his reelection, even informally. For the remainder of their drive home, the Kemps discussed others who had been in attendance, or, as the judge derisively referred to them, "the good, the bad, and the ugly." </p><p> When they arrived home, he headed for his den, where Marian saw to it that the bar was kept well stocked with his favorite brands. "I'm going to have a nightcap. Should I pour two?" </p><p> "No thank you, dear. I'm going up." </p><p> "Cool the bedroom down. This heat is unbearable." </p><p> Marian climbed the curved staircase that had recently been featured in a home-design magazine. For the photo, she'd worn a designer ball gown and her canary-diamond necklace. The portrait had turned out quite well, if she did say so herself. The judge had been pleased with the accompanying article, which had praised her for making their home into the showplace it was. </p><p> The upstairs hallway was dark, but she was relieved to see light beneath the door of Janey's room. Even though it was summer vacation, the judge had imposed a curfew on their seventeen-year-old. Last night, she had flouted the curfew and hadn't come in until almost dawn. It was obvious that she'd been drinking, and, unless Marian was mistaken, the stench that clung to her clothing was that of marijuana. Worse, she'd driven herself home in that condition. </p><p> "I've bailed you out for the last time," the judge had bellowed. "If you get another DWI, you're on your own, young lady. I won't pull a single string. I'll let it go straight on your record." </p><p> Janey had replied with a bored, "So fucking what?" </p><p> The scene had grown so loud and vituperative that Marian feared the neighbors might overhear despite the acre of manicured greenbelt between their property and the next. The quarrel had ended with Janey stomping into her room and slamming the door, then locking it behind her. She hadn't spoken to either of them all day. </p><p> But apparently the judge's most recent threat had made an impression. Janey was at home, and by her standards, it was early. Marian paused outside Janey's door and raised her fist, about to knock. But through the door she could hear the voice of that woman deejay Janey listened to when she was in one of her mellow moods. She was a welcome change from the obnoxious deejays on the acid rock and rap stations. </p><p> Janey tended to throw a tantrum whenever she felt her privacy was being violated. Her mother was disinclined to disturb this tenuous peace, so, without knocking, she lowered her hand and continued down the hallway to the master suite. </p><p><br> Toni Armstrong awoke with a start. </p><p> She lay unmoving, listening for a noise that might have awakened her. Had one of the children called out for her? Was Brad snoring? </p><p> No, the house was silent except for the low whir of the air-conditioning vents in the ceiling. A sound hadn't awakened her. Not even the soughing of her husband's breath. Because the pillow beside hers was undisturbed. </p><p> Toni got up and pulled on a lightweight robe. She glanced at the clock: 1:42. And Brad still hadn't come home. </p><p> Before going downstairs, she checked the children's rooms. Although the girls got tucked into their separate beds each night, they invariably wound up sleeping together in one. Only sixteen months apart, they were often mistaken for twins. They looked virtually identical now, their sturdy little bodies curled up together, tousled heads sharing the pillow. Toni pulled a sheet up over them, then took a moment to admire their innocent beauty before tiptoeing from the room. </p><p> Toy spaceships and action figures littered the floor of her son's bedroom. She carefully avoided stepping on them as she made her way to the bed. He slept on his stomach, legs splayed, one arm hanging down the side of the bed. </p><p> She took the opportunity to stroke his cheek. He'd reached the age where her demonstrations of affection made him grimace and squirm away. As the firstborn, he thought he had to act the little man. </p><p> But thinking of him becoming a man filled her with a desperation that was close to panic. </p><p> As she descended the staircase, several of the treads creaked, but Toni liked a house with the quirks and imperfections that gave it character. They had been lucky to acquire this house. It was in a good neighborhood with an elementary school nearby. The price had been reduced by owners anxious to sell. Parts of it had needed attention, but she had volunteered to make most of the repairs herself in order to fit the purchase into their budget. </p><p> Working on the house had kept her busy while Brad was getting settled into his new practice. She'd taken the time and effort to do necessary repairs before finishing with the cosmetic work. Her patience and diligence had paid off. The house wasn't only prettier in appearance, but sound from the inside out. Its flaws hadn't been glossed over with a fresh coat of paint without first being fixed. </p><p> Unfortunately, not everything was as easily fixable as houses. </p><p> As she had feared, all the rooms downstairs were dark and empty. In the kitchen, she turned on the radio to ward off the ominous pressure of the silence. She poured herself a glass of milk she didn't want and forced herself to sip it calmly. </p><p> Maybe she was doing her husband a disservice. He might very well be attending a seminar on taxes and financial planning. He had announced over dinner that he would be out for most of the evening. </p><p> "Remember, hon," he'd said when she expressed her surprise, "I told you about it earlier this week." </p><p> "No you didn't." </p><p> "I'm sorry. I thought I did. I intended to. Pass the potato salad, please. It's great, by the way. What's that spice?" </p><p> "Dill. This is the first I've heard of a seminar tonight, Brad." </p><p> "The partners recommended it. What they learned at the last one saved them a bundle in taxes." </p><p> "Then maybe I should go, too. I could stand to learn more about all that." </p><p> "Good idea. We'll watch for the next one. You're required to enroll in advance." </p><p> He'd told her the time and location of the seminar, told her not to wait up for him because there was an informal discussion session following the formal presentation and he didn't know how long it would last. He had kissed her and the kids before he left. He walked to his car with a gait that was awfully jaunty for someone going to a seminar on taxes and financial planning. </p><p> Toni finished her glass of milk. </p><p> She called her husband's cell phone for the third time, and as with the previous two calls, got his voice mail. She didn't leave a message. She thought about calling the auditorium where the seminar had taken place, but that would be a waste of time. No one would be there at this hour. </p><p> After seeing Brad off tonight, she had clean...</p></p><h2>This Heart of Mine</h2><p><p><em>New York Times </em>bestselling author&nbsp;Susan Elizabeth Phillips magic is vibrantly alive, and it's on display in <em>This Heart of Mine,</em> the fifth book in her wildly popular Chicago Stars series!</p><p>Molly Somerville loves her career as the creator of the Daphne the Bunny children's book series, but the rest of her life could use some improvement.

Since 1985 he has lived in Buenos Aires, where he obtained a Ph.D. in Mathematical Science. He has written several highly acclaimed novels and books of short stories. The Oxford Murders, whiAn Argentine graduate student at Oxford stumbles upon a series of murders linked to a mathematical code. He seeks to solve the puzzle with one of his professors, a renowned logician and the author of a book on the mathematics of serial killers. Despite some references to Fermat's Last Theorem, even the "math-phobic" should have no problem enjoying this cerebral whodunit. Narrator Jonathan Davis shines as Professor Arthur Seldom, characterizing him with a melodious Scots brogue. Davis's embodiment of the professor drives the narrative, which is also helped by careful differentiation of the other characters. Especially splendid is Davis's rendition of a lively Irish nurse, who also happens to be the love interest of the young South American narrator.

That was when Dana Sterling, half-Human, half-Zentraedi commander of an elite Hovertank unit, stepped into the spotlight of interstellar history!<br>#8 METAL FIRE<br>An alien fortress had crashlanded on Earth--brought down in the struggle between the Robotech Masters and Earth's Human inhabitants. Now the fortress dared someone to penetrate its dark mysteries. And who better to brave that ship than Dana Sterling's 15th Squadron ATACs--after all, they had brought the thing down to begin with!<br>#9 THE FINAL NIGHTMARE<br>The Robotech Masters' Protoculture Matrix was degenerating, transforming into the Flower of Life--which was sure to draw the savage, merciless Invid across the galaxy to Earth. But the Army of the Southern Cross vowed to fight to the bitter end. And Dana Sterling raged a desperate war of her own to decipher her strange visions and the secret of her alien heritage...</p><p>CHAPTER<br> ONE<br> &nbsp;<br> Those who were surprised at Dana Sterling&#x2019;s choice of a career in the military displayed not only a lack of understanding about Dana but also a failure to comprehend the nature of Protoculture, and how it shaped destiny.<br> &nbsp;<br> After all, as a mere babe in arms Dana had played a pivotal part in a vital battle in the First Robotech War, the attack to take the Zentraedi&#x2019;s orbital mecha factory; with two of the greatest fighters in history as parents, is it any surprise that she would follow the warrior&#x2019;s trade?<br> &nbsp;<br> But more important, Dana is the only offspring of a Human/Zentraedi mating on Earth, and the Protoculture was working strongly through her. She is to be a centerpiece of the ongoing conflict the Protoculture has shaped, and that means being a Robotech soldier in excelsis.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dr. Lazlo Zand, notes for Event Horizon: Perspectives on Dana Sterling and the Second Robotech War<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a date that every schoolchild knew, though for some its significance had become a bit blurred.<br> &nbsp;<br> But not for the people gathered in the auditorium at the Southern Cross Military Academy. Many of the veterans on the speakers&#x2019; platform and among the academy teaching staff and cadre knew the meaning of the date because they had lived through it. Everyone in the graduating class revered it and the tradition of self-sacrifice and courage it represented&#x2014;a tradition being passed along to them today.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Today we celebrate not only your achievements as the first graduating class of the Academy,&#x201d; Supreme Commander Leonard was saying, glowering down at the young men and women seated in rows before him. &#x201c;We also celebrate the memory of the brave people who have served in our planet&#x2019;s defense before you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Leonard continued, summarizing the last great clash of the Robotech War. If he had stopped in mid-syllable, pointed at any one of the graduating cadets, and asked him or her to take the story from there, the graduate would have done it with even more detail and accuracy.<br> &nbsp;<br> They all knew it by heart: how Admiral Henry Gloval had taken the rusting, all-but-decommissioned SDF-1 into the air for a final confrontation with the psychopathic Zentraedi warlord Khyron, and died in the inferno of that battle.<br> &nbsp;<br> They also knew the high honor roll of the women of the bridge watch who had died with him: Kim Young; Sammie Porter; Vanessa Leeds&#x2014;all enlisted rating techs scarcely older than any of the cadets&#x2014;and Commander Claudia Grant.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sitting at the end of her squad&#x2019;s row, Cadet Major Dana Sterling looked down the line of faces beside her. One, with skin the color of dark honey, stared up into the light from the stage. Dana could see that Bowie Grant&#x2014;nephew of that same Commander Claudia Grant and Dana&#x2019;s close friend since childhood&#x2014;betrayed no emotion.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana didn&#x2019;t know whether to be content or worried. Carrying the name of a certified RDF hero could be a tough burden to bear, as Dana well knew.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leonard went on about unselfish acts of heroism and passing the torch to a roomful of cadets, none of whom had yet reached twenty. They had had it all drilled into them for years, and were squirming in their seats, eager to get moving, to get to their first real assignments.<br> Or at any rate, most felt that way; looking down the line, Dana could see a withdrawn look on Bowie&#x2019;s face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Leonard, with his bullet-shaped shaved head, massive as a bear and dripping with medals and ribbons, droned on to the end without saying anything new. It was almost silly for him to tell them that the Earth, slowly rebuilding in the seventeen years since the end of the Robotech War&#x2014;fifteen since Khyron the Backstabber had launched his suicide attack&#x2014;was a regrettably feudal place. Who would know that better than the young people who had grown up in it?<br> &nbsp;<br> Or that there must be a devotion to the common good and a commitment to a brighter Human future? Who had more commitment than the young men and women sitting there, who had sworn to serve that cause and proved their determination by enduring years of merciless testing and training?<br> &nbsp;<br> At last, thankfully, Leonard was done, and it was time to be sworn in. Dana came to attention with her squad, a unit that had started out company-size three years before.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana stood straight and proud, a young woman with a globe of swirling blond hair, average height for a female cadet, curvaceous in a long-legged way. She was blue-eyed, freckled, and pugnosed, and very tired of being called &#x201c;cute.&#x201d; Fixed in the yellow mane over her left ear was a fashion accessory appropriate to her time&#x2014;a hair stay shaped to look like a curve of instrumentation suggesting a half-headset, like a crescent of Robotechnology sculpted from polished onyx.<br> &nbsp;<br> The graduating class received their assignments as they went up to the stage to accept their diplomas. Dana found herself holding her breath, hoping, hoping.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then the supreme commander was before her, an overly beefy man whose neck spilled out in rolls above his tight collar. He had flaring brows and a hand that engulfed hers. But despite what the UEG public relations people said about him, she found herself disliking him. Leonard talked a good fight but had very little real combat experience; he was better at political wheeling and dealing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana was trying to hide her quick, shallow breathing as she went from Leonard&#x2019;s too-moist handshake to the aide whose duty it was to tell the new graduates their first assignments.<br> The aide frowned at a computer printout. Then he glanced down his nose at Dana, looking her over disapprovingly. &#x201c;Congratulations. You go to the Fifteenth squad, Alpha Tactical Armored Corps,&#x201d; he said with a sniff.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana had learned how to hide emotions and reactions at the Academy; she was an old hand at it. So she didn&#x2019;t squeal with delight or throw her diploma into the air in exultation.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was in a daze as she filed back to her seat, her squad following behind. The ATACs! The 15th squad! Hovertanks!<br> &nbsp;<br> Let others try for the soft, safe, rear-echelon jobs, or the glamourous fighter outfits; nowadays the armored units were the cutting edge of Robotechnology, and the teeth and claws of the United Earth Government&#x2019;s military&#x2014;the Army of the Southern Cross.<br> &nbsp;<br> And the 15th had the reputation of being one of the best, if not the best. Under their daredevil leader, First Lieutenant Sean Phillips, they had become not only one of the most decorated but also one of the most court-martial-prone outfits around&#x2014;a real black-sheep squad.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana figured that was right up her alley. She would have been graduating at the top of her class, with marks and honors succeeding generations would have found hard to beat, if not for certain peccadillos, disciplinary lapses, and scrapes with the MPs. She knew most of it wasn&#x2019;t really her fault, though. The way some people saw it, she had entered the Academy with several strikes against her, and she had had to fight against that the whole way.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cadets who called her &#x201c;halfbreed&#x201d; usually found themselves flat on their faces, bleeding, with Dana kneeling on them. Instructors or cadre who treated her like just one more trainee found that they had a bright if impulsive pupil; those who gave any hint of contempt for her parentage found that their rank and station were no protection.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cadet officers awakened to find themselves hoisted from flagpoles&nbsp;...&nbsp;a cadre sergeant&#x2019;s quarters were mysteriously walled in, sealing him inside....&nbsp;The debutante cotillion of the daughter of a certain colonel was enlivened by a visit from a dozen or so chimps, baboons, and orangutans from the Academy&#x2019;s Primate Research Center&nbsp;...&nbsp;and so on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana reckoned she would fit into the 15th just fine.<br> &nbsp;<br> She realized with a start that she didn&#x2019;t know where Bowie was going. She felt a bit ashamed that she had reveled in her own good fortune and had forgotten about him.<br> &nbsp;<br> But when she turned, Bowie was looking up the row at her. He flashed his handsome smile, but there was a resigned look to it. He held his hand up to flash five outspread fingers&#x2014;once, twice, three times.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana caught her breath. He&#x2019;s pulled assignment to the 15th, too!<br> &nbsp;<br> Bowie didn&#x2019;t seem to be too elated about it, though. He closed the other fingers of his hand and drew his forefinger across his throat in a silent gesture of doom, watching her sadly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the ceremonies seemed to go on forever, but at last the graduates were dismissed for a few brief days of leave before reporting to their new units.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somehow Dana lost Bowie in the crush of people. He had no family or friends among the watching crowd; but neither did she. All the blood relatives they had were years-gone on the SDF-3&#x2019;s all-important mission to seek out the Robotech Masters somewhere in the far reaches of the galaxy.<br> &nbsp;<br> The only adult to whom Dana and Bowie were close, Major General Rolf Emerson, was conducting an inspection of the orbital defense forces and unable to attend the ceremony. For a time in her childhood, Dana had had three very strange but dear self-appointed godfathers, but they had passed away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dana felt a spasm of envy for the ex-cadets who were surrounded by parents and siblings and neighbors. Then she shrugged it off, irritated at herself for the moment&#x2019;s self-pity; Bowie was all the family she had now. She went off to find him.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Universal Monsters #06: Bride Of Frankenstein</h2><p>UNIVERSAL MONSTERS is a fresh new horror series for middle-grade readers.

It would be impossible to prepare an outline of the plot (as opposed, say, to?"The Making of Americans"). The action is purely interior: a great deal is noticed, digested, absorbed, compared. The result can be read simply as an account of being in the countryside, or more complexly, as an investigation into the interlocking nature of things and into the ways that language can be used for description.?"Lucy Church Amiably"?is finally, in Miss Stein's own words, "A Novel of Romantic beauty and nature and which Looks Like an Engraving."</p></p><p>There is no summarizing or explaining the writings of Gertrude Stein. With the exception of her fledgling efforts like <i>Three Lives</i> or her funny, successful memoir, <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, her fictions are without conventional plot, setting, or character. They are intellectual flowers, each sentence growing or receding from the one before it, repeating its main points with subtle, telling changes. In <i>Lucy Church Amiably</i>, first published in Paris in 1930 and long out of print, Stein describes the landscape and pastoral life of central France (while writing, she was staying near a small village named Lucy) in and through her character Lucy Church: "Gradually remembering a lake. Gradually. Remembering. A lake. In gradually remembering a lake by the shore of the lake where they were sitting." Yet Stein is not opaque or purely musical: she always provides solid details in unexpected places, specializing, as the critic Fred Dupee put it, in "the mingling of apparent conviction with transparent nonsense." She is a central figure in the modernist movement, but her relentless pleasure in her quirky, handmade idiom can repel the unwary reader. Although it is a delight to have this reprint, a brief introduction would have been useful for the uninitiated. Those interested in Stein should also turn to her <i>Selected Writings</i>, or, for a painless entr�e to her work, begin with <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Gertrude Stein (1874 1946) was born in Pittsburgh to a prosperous German-Jewish family. She was educated in France and the United States, worked under the pioneering psychologist William James, and later studied medicine. With her brother Leo she was an important patron of the arts, acquiring works by many contemporary artists, most famously Picasso, while her home became a popular meeting place for writers and painters from Matisse to Hemingway. Her books include Three Lives, Tender Buttons, and The Autobiography of Alice B.

'Not even here will you be safe from my vengeance!'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>The sky ship bucked and swayed as it fought against the violent air currents which kept all but the most reckless or foolhardy from venturing over the lip of the Edge and down into the abyss below. For here, where the warm Mire mud cascaded down over the cliff face in huge oozing mudflows and met the icy air currents of the void below, gales and hurricanes and turbulent fog were whipped up into a frenzy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'No matter how far down into these infernal depths you descend,' Wind Jackal raged, shaking his fist at the eternal gloom below, 'I shall hunt you down . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Father, please,' the young sky pirate by the captain's side protested, and laid a hand on his shoulder. 'The crew . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Wind Jackal turned from the balustrade at the helm of the Galerider, the look of glazed fury on his face giving way to a frown as he found the eyes of his crew upon him. There was Spillins, the ancient oakelf, high up in the caternest. Ratbit, the swivel-eyedmobgnome, his heavy jacket laden with charms. Steg Jambles, the harpooneer, with young Tem Barkwater, as ever, by his side. Sagbutt, the fierce flat-head goblin, his neck-rings gleaming. And Maris Pallitax, staring up from the fore-deck. They all shared the same expression - one of barely contained panic as they stared wide-eyed at their captain, looking to him for reassurance.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Only the newest member of the crew seemed immune to the terror of this fearful place he had brought them to. The Stone Pilot. Concealed inside the tall conical hood that she never removed, and silent as the day - only weeks earlier - when she had been rescued from the Deepwoods slave market, she tended the flight-rock, seemingly oblivious to all around her. The sight of the Stone Pilot applying the cooling rods and adjusting the blazing sumpwood burners which surrounded the flight-rock seemed to calm thecaptain, for he took the wheel from his son with a grim smile.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Forgive me, Quint,' he said, running his hands over the flight-levers. 'It's just that, after all these years, he seems so close . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>A blast of wind hit the Galerider, making the sky ship shudder from stem to stern, and forcing Wind Jackal to feverishly adjust the hull-weights. His hands raced expertly over the bone-handled flight-levers on either side of the great wheel, raising this one a tad, lowering that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Sky curse this infernal wind!' he snarled, scanning the mud-clogged cliff edge. 'I can't hold her much longer. We must find somewhere to tether . . .'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Suddenly, the strident voice of Spillins cried out from the caternest. 'Jutting rock at fifty strides!'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Thank Sky,' Wind Jackal murmured, removing his right hand from the hull-weight levers for a split second; just long enough to put the carved tilderhorn amulet gratefully to his lips. 'Hold her steady as you can, Stone Pilot. We're depending on you. Tem! Ratbit!' he bellowed. 'Man the winch! Steg, prepare to descend.'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>A chorus of voices and a flurry of movement erupted all round the sky ship as the crew hurried to do their captain's bidding, taking up their positions and getting to grips with the ship's heavy equipment. Ratbit barked commands at the young and lanky Tem Barkwater as the pair of them swung the winding-winch round until the great ironwood wheel was jutting out over the port side of the sky ship. Steg Jambles secured a leather harness round his midriff, seized the rope that dangled from the winch-wheel andattached one to the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Jutting rock directly beneath us!' Spillins shouted down.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Quint and Maris scurried across the deck - skirting round Filbus Queep the thin-faced quartermaster, who had appeared from his quarters above the aft-hold - and peered over the side. Sure enough, there was the single jutting crag that Spillins had spotted, a small island of stillness and stability amidst the constantly shifting Mire. It stood proud of the oozing white mud, which swirled slowly round it, then poured over the edge in great globules that glistened for a moment, before disappearing into the eternal gloom below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Quint turned and looked up at the flight-rock platform. The Stone Pilot was standing to the left of the great rock, her back towards him. Since the moment they'd first met, the mysterious figure had uttered not a single word. Yet the hunched urgency with which she worked now, feverishly pumping the rock-bellows and riddling the ashes from the roaring furnace, spoke louder than any words.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Every moment the Galerider hovered here, untethered over the void, it risked being swept away and lost for ever in Open Sky. But the Stone Pilot was a natural, whose skills seemed to grow with every passing day. Under her care now, the heated flight-rockwas gradually becoming less buoyant and the Galerider was descending towards the jutting rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Now, Steg! Now!' bellowed the captain, his hands leaping from lever to bone-handled lever as he fought to keep the sky ship hovering motionless in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Steg Jambles didn't need telling twice. He tested the rope with a quick tug - just to be on the safe side - before stepping off the side of the ship. Tem and Ratbit took the strain and, when Steg had gathered himself, began turning the pulley-lever. Slowly, carefully, they lowered the thick-set fore-decker down through the air towards the jutting rock.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>At the balustrade, Maris gripped Quint's arm and turned to look up at him, her dark eyes glistening with a mixture of awe and excitement. Ever since Wind Jackal had plucked the pair of them away from Sanctaphrax those few short weeks earlier, she had seen so much: the snow-white desolation of the Mire, the treacherous glow of the Twilight Woods, the endless canopy of the Deepwoods from above - as well as the horrors of the slave market from which both the Stone Pilot and Tem Barkwater had been rescued. But this. . . this was the most chilling place they had visited so far, and she shivered with dread.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'The great void,' she murmured tremulously. 'The realm of ghosts and demons and . . . what was it your father said?'&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Half-formed things,' said Quint, staring down at the fore-decker dangling below.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'Stop!' Steg's bellowed command was just audible above the turbulent air.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Tem and Ratbit stopped turning the winch at once, and slid the locking bolt across. Far below, Steg gripped hold of a rough chunk of the jutting rock with one white-knuckled hand, while with the other, he unhooked the glinting rock-spike from his sky pirate coat.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>'When you're ready, Master Steg!' Wind Jackal called out from the helm, battling to hold the ship steady, as the howling wind battered and buffeted it, seemingly from all sides at once. &nbsp; Steg thrust the pointed end of the spur into a narrow crack in the rock then, with a great round-bowled hammer that he'd unhooked from his belt, he pounded the spike into place with a flurry of colossal blows. As the sound of Steg's hammer blows rose up from below, Wind Jackal smiled grimly.</p><h2>John Wesley&#39;s Commentary on the Bible</h2><p>Used but in very good condition.</p><p></p><h2>Systematic Theology: Roman Catholic Perspectives, Vol. 1</h2><p>In these two landmark volumes, Fiorenza and Galvin have assembled a dozen of North America&#39;s leading Roman Catholic theologians to discern the state of the question and the most promising directions in each of the major doctrinal areas.</p><p></p><h2>Southern Living: 1997 Annual Recipes (Southern Living Annual Recipes)</h2><p>A compilation of more than one thousand of the best recipes designed to please the palate from Southern Living magazine includes tips and techniques for food safety, kitchen shortcuts, easy entertaining, and make-ahead options, accompanied by full-color illustrations.

He was a stage designer, artist, writer, gardener, and an outspoken AIDS and queer rights activist in the UK and the United States. His books include <i>At Your Own Risk</i>, <i>Modern Nature</i>, and <i>Smiling in Slow Motion</i>, all available from the University of Minnesota Press.This impassioned and reflective final volume in the late avant-garde filmmaker's diaries articulately mixes personal recollections, travelogues, and interviews, plus a few fantastic vignettes thrown in. Written during the making of Jarman's apocalyptic antipatriotic film The Last of England, the journal more or less anchors itself on that work-in-progress, in contrast to the color schemes of Chroma (1995), the previous volume of diaries. This book shares much of the same subject matter with its predecessors: Jarman's esthetic perspective and artistic training as a painter, his struggle with his sexual identity and escapades during the sexual revolution, his opinions on the British cinema world and its reactions to his controversial films Caravaggio, The Tempest, et al. Filming The Last of England supplies this book with not only a thematic focus but also a sense of immediacy, as Jarman works out his film vision of an Albion wrecked by its own imperial identity. Unpacking the film's literary and visual allusions, he succinctly describes it as ``a dream allegory [where] the poet wakes in a visionary landscape.'' The most striking feature of the journal, however, is Jarman's bitter yet ruefully sympathetic portrait of his domineering father--``the classic fag's father''--a WW II bomb- squadron leader who embodies much of what his son detests in the English establishment and the military mentality. A keen amateur moviemaker, RAF officer Jarman took films of his bombing runs as well as his family during the war, which wound up in The Last of England as both nostalgia and ironic counterpoint. In a sense, Jarman points out, his father was equally betrayed by his country: Emigrating from New Zealand, he had to become more British than the British and fought an exhausting war only to go adrift in contemporary England. The rich, raw, kaleidoscopic finale of a personal and artistic statement. (100 b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Like Anne Frank, thirteen-year-old Nina is conscious of the extraordinary dangers around her and her family, yet she is preoccupied by ordinary teenage concerns: boys, parties, her appearance, who she wants to be when she grows up. As Nina records her most personal emotions and observations, her reflections shape a diary that is as much a portrait of her intense inner world as it is the Soviet outer one.<br><br>Preserved here, these markings&#x2014;the evidence used to convict Nina as a &#x201c;counterrevolutionary&#x201d;&#x2014;offer today&#x2019;s reader a fascinating perspective on the era in which she lived.</p><p>Does that boy like me? Am I pretty? Will my father be arrested? These were the everyday concerns of thirteen-year-old Moscow schoolgirl Nina Lugovskaya, who began to write a diary in 1932. Her indignant outbursts against Stalin s brutal Terror appear alongside more typical adolescent worries about friends, boys and homework. For five years Nina scribbled down her most intimate thoughts. Then in 1937 Stalin s secret police ransacked Nina s home and discovered her diary. Nina s criticism of the regime provided sufficient evidence for the charge of treason, and she, her mother and two sisters were sentenced to five years  hard labour in the Gulag, followed by seven years  exile. Recently Nina s diary was discovered in the KGB archives. Like Anne Frank s diary, it poignantly reveals life at a time of political upheaval, betrayal and repression through the eyes of an innocent.  Could do for the horrors of Stalinism what the diary of Anne Frank did for the Holocaust . . . the tragedy of Nina Lugovskaya is that a lively, compellingly ordinary girl was made to suffer so grievously for being so human  TimeNo Bio</p><h2>Christmas Collectibles: Tree Ornaments and Memorabilia</h2><p>Shows and describes artificial trees, Christmas ornaments, figurines, cake tins, prints, children&#39;s books, trade cards, and advertising, and lists current values</p><p></p><h2>Ascension &amp; Ecclesia : On the Significance of the Doctrine of Ascension</h2><p>Recent theology offers few attempts to come to grips with the meaning and implications of the ascension of Jesus.

Her many books include <i>Dust Tracks on a Road</i>; <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i>; <i>Jonah's Gourd Vine</i>; <i>Moses, Man of the Mountain</i>; <i>Mules and Men</i>; and <i>Every Tongue Got to Confess</i>. </p>Starred Review. Grade 1-5&#x2013;A fellow courts a girl, and they agree to marry. Sadly, she and her family are such fools that the young man takes off: ...you are the three biggest fools that I ever laid eyes on. I'm going traveling for a year, and if I find three fools as big as you, I'll come back and we'll get married. Does he find them? Of course. This adaptation of the fool story from Hurston's <i>Every Tongue Got to Confess</i> (HarperCollins, 2001) is light and adept. Though Thomas doesn't describe the changes she's made, comparison with the original shows that she's added a small amount of narrative detail and dialogue, hardly altering and not cutting anything from the original. The result is wonderful in voice: rich, hilarious, and satisfying. Tanksley's oil monoprints done in a folk-art style set the story in Hurston's 1920s-'30s with humor and vibrant color in a wide-ranging palette.

It is an attempt at a psychology of soul, an essay in re-visioning psychology from the point of view of soul. This book is therefore old-fashioned and radically novel because it harks back to the classical notions of soul and yet advances ideas that current psychology has not even begun t consider. Because the soul cannot be understood through psychology alone, our vision even leaves the field of psychology as it is usually thought of, and moves widely through history, philosophy, and religion.</p><h2>Collector&#39;s Guide to Decoys (WALLACE-HOMESTEAD COLLECTOR&#39;S GUIDE SERIES)</h2><p>Tells how to start a decoy collection, describes how decoys are constructed and finished, and gives advice on identifying, authenticating, and valuing decoys</p><p>During the last 60 years, the life-size decoys used to lure North American waterfowl and shorebirds within range of hunters' guns have become desirable collectibles. This third guide by these experienced collectors is a good companion to their recent Decoys (Collector Bks., 1992). But while that book describes decoys by the type of bird, this book emphasizes general collecting information such as methods of making decoys, ways to recognize fakes, buying at auction, and a survey of styles by region and maker.

Why is the "argument from design" so tenacious, and does Darwinism--itself still evolving after all these years--necessarily undo it? </p><p> The definitive work on these contentious questions, <i>Darwin and Design</i> surveys the argument from design from its introduction by the Greeks, through the coming of Darwinism, down to the present day. In clear, non-technical language Michael Ruse, a well-known authority on the history and philosophy of Darwinism, offers a full and fair assessment of the status of the argument from design in light of both the advances of modern evolutionary biology and the thinking of today's philosophers--with special attention given to the supporters and critics of "intelligent design." </p><p> The first comprehensive history and exposition of Western thought about design in the natural world, this important work suggests directions for our thinking as we move into the twenty-first century. A thoroughgoing guide to a perennially controversial issue, the book makes its own substantial contribution to the ongoing debate about the relationship between science and religion, and between evolution and its religious critics. </p></p><p><b>Michael Ruse</b> is Lucyle T.

Carr forage through the mountains of Mexico and the deserts of the American Southwest in celebration of the strength and wonder of adobe design style. From its humble beginnings to its present-day renaissance, Casa Adobe unearths the homes, haciendas, and holiday getaways that have blended handcrafted details, natural materials, and cross-cultural furnishings to express the elegant simplicity of adobe living. Stunning photographs reveal the textures of both traditional and modern homes and the unique marriages between adobe's ancient simplicity and homeowners' eclectic global treasures. The interior design elements-hand-wrought iron chandeliers, punched tin and copper sconces, painted Mexican-country furniture, early American antiques, Navajo textiles, African folk art, contemporary paintings, New Mexican retablos and Pueblo pottery-are at happy communion inside the comfortable surrounds of adobe.

The artist's playful, evocative use of constrictions and overlays on the human form, including twine, belts, tape and other everyday materials, are both humorous and fraught, offering an intensely personal assessment of the variable meanings of pleasure and the female nude as a staple of fine art photography. Callis has been an active artist since the 1960s, working in painting, sculpture and photography, among other media, and is known for capturing complex and often opposing emotions in a single piece. <i>Jo Ann Callis: Other Rooms</i> is an exquisitely produced artist's book containing Callis' photographs of the human form from her 1976-77 provisionally titled series Early Color, as well as a selection of black-and-white photographs from the same period. In this intimate volume, Callis photographs her models nude, frequently in close proximity, and in anonymous and mysterious settings, juxtaposing tactile props like honey, sand and fabric with skin. The photographs in this volume are at once beautiful and discomfiting, delicate and raw, mysterious and thoughtful, and confirm Callis' important place in the history of 1970s color photography.</p><p>Jo Ann Callis began teaching at CalArts in 1976. Her work has been widely exhibited in such venues as the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Hammer Museum, and Museum of Contemporary Art, all in Los Angeles; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and Gallery Min, Tokyo. In 2009 a retrospective of her work, Woman Twirling, was presented by the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.

She lives in New York City.<br><br><br><p>A student of Heinecken at UCLA, Callis offers a female counterpoint to his work: She teases us with sexuality through provocative poses, skin altered by lipstick and binding, relics of fetishes, and another's roving hands. &#x2013; <i>American Photo</i></p><br><p>Callis helped pioneer studio photography into its full, chromatic potential. She was among the first to blur interiors with interiority in a manner both uncanny and unutterable, like the moment a song shifts from major to minor key, or a scene from a dream in which you can&#x2019;t name the face, but you know exactly whom you are with. Her picture&#x2019;s aren&#x2019;t coquettish; there isn&#x2019;t any cheeckiness to her suggstions. There is only an odd arousal, an absolute command of the strange. &#x2013; <i>Dazed</i></p> <br><p>The images present a bloodless eroticism, uncanny, simultaneously sexual and absented of desire. &#x2013; <i>American Suburbx</i></p> <br><p>Callis&#x2019; body of work doesn&#x2019;t just speak to hidden desires; it is also candid and almost unsettlingly sensuous in its fragmented treatment of the body, existing in a detached, dreamlike state of timelessness without definitive context. &#x2013; <i>Interview</i></p> <br><p>Callis&#x2019; lavishly saturated Cibachromes of cinematic, painstakingly composed tableaux of food, the body, and everyday objects play with surrealism and tease the subconscious, oftentimes set within the domestic space and dealing with tropes of femininity. &#x2013; <i>Interview</i></p> <br><p>Her imagery feels deliciously voyeuristic, with many of her subjects&#x2019; faces obscured, or just a ash of bound flesh in frame.

Whether you are just discovering the divine richness of Scripture or have long been a passionate student, you&#x2019;ll find a deeper understanding of God and renewed insight for your journey.</p><p><b>JOHN PIPER</b>&nbsp;is founder and teacher of DesiringGod.org&nbsp;and chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary. For thirty-three years he served as pastor at Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis. He is the author of more than fifty books, including the contemporary classic<i>, Desiring God</i>. He and his wife, Noel, have five children and twelve grandchildren.A Word to the Reader<br><br>One of the reasons I put together collections of short meditations is that my life has been changed as much by paragraphs as by books. Books on one topic are valuable. They let the author explore all the angles of an insight. But where do the insights themselves come from? Usually they come from paragraphs. Even sentences. For reasons<br>not entirely explainable, God can make a single paragraph life changing.<br><br>Perhaps some evening your soul is hungry. Not for anything in particular, just a soul-hunger. A longing. Something is needed beyond what television is going to give. Something about God, or about the meaning of your life, or about eternity. You&#x2019;re tired and you know you probably can&#x2019;t stay awake to read twenty pages. So you pick up a book that you know focuses on eternal things, a Godward book. And three minutes later you have seen something, and you will never be the same again.<br><br>It may take a lifetime to sound the depths of what you just saw. But the seeing happens in an instant. It&#x2019;s as if God takes the paragraph in his fingers and uses it to adjust the lens on the eye of your soul, and something wonderful comes into focus that you had never seen before.<br><br>Isn&#x2019;t it amazing to think about the relationship between God&#x2019;s focusing fingers and the human activity of writing and reading? You may have read that same paragraph before, perhaps just the other evening. But this time God put his fingers on it and turned the lens just one more focusing notch. What this means is that I should pray as a writer and you should pray as a reader. We should ask God to do this focusing.<br><br>I think of your reading and my writing as a kind of partnership in the pursuit of a Godward miracle. I write, you read, but God gives the sight. What we both want is this miracle of seeing&#x2014;seeing lifechanging things about God and life and eternity.<br><br>In one of his letters the apostle Paul said, &#x201c;By reading you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ&#x201d; (Ephesians 3:4, author&#x2019;s translation). But was reading enough? A few sentences later he prayed that they &#x201c;may have strength to...know the love of Christ&#x201d; (Ephesians 3:18&#x2013;19). Something more was needed than reading. Something from God&#x2014;he called it &#x201c;strength to know.&#x201d; Earlier he had prayed that the eyes of his readers&#x2019; hearts would be &#x201c;enlightened, that you may know&#x201d; (Ephesians 1:18). Something from God is needed&#x2014;in answer to prayer. This is what I meant when I said that God takes a human paragraph and puts his fingers on the lens of the eye of your<br>soul. The slightest turn and we are made strong with sight. We are never the same again.<br><br>So I have written. And you are reading. And God is ready to act. My words are not Scripture. They are not infallible like God&#x2019;s words. But my earnest aim in all I write is to be faithful to God&#x2019;s written Word in the Bible. To point to God and his Son and his works and his ways. My aim is a Godward book in the hope that God will put his fingers on its paragraphs and turn the lens of the eye of your soul, ever so delicately, and bring glories into focus.<br><br>This is how God forms us into his image. &#x201c;Beholding the glory of the Lord, [we] are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another&#x201d; (2 Corinthians 3:18). This is our aim: From a Godward paragraph, to a sight of glory, to a Godward heart.<br><br>A very special word of thanks is due to David Mathis, executive editor at Desiring God. David helped me assemble these meditations from all the different places and times where I had written them. After I reworked them for this book, he provided his sharp theological, stylistic, and formatting eye to help me refine them for final release. I admire David&#x2019;s gifts and love his friendship. Thank you, David, for your partnership.<br><br>I have enjoyed a long and happy relationship with Multnomah Books, especially in bringing my shorter writings to publication. <i>A Godward Heart</i> is a continuation of what we began in <i>A Godward Life</i>, <i>Book One</i> (2001), continued in <i>A Godward Life, Book Two</i> (2003), <i>Pierced by the Word</i> (2003),<i> Life as a Vapor</i> (2004), and <i>Taste and See </i>(2005).

Still, he couldn't resist needling his friend.</p><p>"Copeland still putting the screws to you?"</p><p>"And how," Devon muttered. "He's determined for me to marry Ashley. He won't budge on the deal unless I agree. And now that we've relocated the resort and begun construction, I'm ready to get on with the next step. I don't want him to lose confidence over this blown deal. Problem is, he's insisted on a dating period. He wants Ashley to be comfortable around me.

You're out of your mind for pursuing this."</p><p>Ryan curled his lip and turned to look at his friend. "I have no doubt I'm better off. I'm not looking for her so I can welcome her back into my life."</p><p>"Then why did you hire an investigator to find her, for God's sake? You'd be better off letting the past stay in the past. Get over her. Move on."</p><p>Ryan was silent for a long moment. It wasn't a question he could entirely answer. How could he explain the burning desire to know where she was? What she was doing. If she was all right. He shouldn't care, damn it. He should forget all about her, but he couldn't.</p><p>"I want some answers," he finally muttered. "She never cashed the check I gave her. I'd just like to know that nothing has happened to her."</p><p>The excuse sounded lame even to him.</p><p>Devon raised an eyebrow and sipped at the expensive wine. "After what she pulled, I'd imagine she's feeling pretty damn stupid. I wouldn't want to show my face either."</p><p>Ryan shrugged. "Maybe." But he couldn't shake the feeling that it was something more. Why was he even worried? Why should he care?</p><p><i>Why hadn't she cashed the check?</i></p><p>Why couldn't he get her out of his mind? She haunted him. For six months, he had cursed her, lain awake at night wondering where she was and if she was safe. And he hated that he cared, even though he convinced himself he'd worry about any woman under the same circumstances.</p><p>Devon shrugged. "Your time and your dime. Oh, look, there's Cam.

He was tall and broad chested, and he wore power and refinement like most other people wore clothing. The stone set of his demeanor made him unapproachable by most. He could be a mean son of a bitch, but he could usually be counted on to relax around his friends.</p><p>The problem was, the only people he counted as friends were Ryan, Devon and Rafe. He didn't have much patience for anyone else.</p><p>"Sorry I'm late," Cameron said as he approached the two men. Then he glanced over the dance floor and his gaze stopped when he came to Rafe and Bryony. "How did the ceremony go?"</p><p>"Oh, it was lovely," Devon drawled. "All a woman could hope for, I'm guessing. Rafe didn't give a damn as long as the end result was Bryony being his."</p><p>Cam emitted a dry chuckle. "Poor bastard. I don't know whether to offer my condolences or my congratulations."</p><p>Ryan grinned. "Bryony's a good woman. Rafe's lucky to have her."</p><p>Devon nodded and even Cameron smiled, if you could call the tiny lift at the corner of his mouth a true smile. Then Cam turned to Devon, his eyes gleaming with unholy amusement.</p><p>"Word is you're not far from taking a trip down the aisle yourself."</p><p>Devon muttered a crude expletive and flipped up his middle finger along the side of his wineglass. "Let's not ruin Rafe's wedding by talking about mine. I'm more interested in knowing whether you were able to acquire the site for the new location of our hotel since Moon Island is now officially a bust."</p><p>Cam's eyebrows went up in exaggerated shock. "You doubt me? I'll have you know that twenty prime acres of beachfront property on St. Angelo is now ours. And I got a damn good deal. Better yet, construction will commence as soon as we can move crews in. If we really dig in, we'll come close to hitting our original deadline for the grand opening."</p><p>Their gazes automatically went to Rafe, who was still wrapped around his bride. Yeah, the man had caused them a major setback when he pulled the plug on the Moon Island venture, but it was hard for Ryan to get up in arms about it when Rafe looked so damn happy.</p><p>Ryan's pocket vibrated, and he reached down to pull his phone out. He was about to hit the ignore button when he saw who was calling. He frowned. "Excuse me, I need to take this."</p><p>Cameron and Devon waved him off and returned to their bantering as Ryan hurried out of the building. As soon as he stepped outside, the sea breeze ruffled his hair and the tang of salt filled his nose.</p><p>The weather was seasonable but by no means hot. It was about as perfect a day as you could ask for, especially for a wedding on the beach.</p><p>He turned to look at the distant waves and brought the phone to his ear.</p><p>"Beardsley," he said by way of a terse greeting.</p><p>"I think I've found her," his lead investigator said with no preamble.</p><p>Ryan tensed, his hand gripping the phone until his fingers went numb. "Where?"</p><p>"I haven't had time to send a man to get a visual confirmation yet. I only just got the information in a few minutes ago. I felt strongly enough about her identity to give you a heads-up. I should know more by tomorrow."</p><p>"Where?" Ryan demanded again.</p><p>"Houston. She's working in a diner there. There was a mix-up originally in her social security number. Her employer reported it wrong. When he put in the correction, she popped on to my radar. I'll have photos and a full report for you by tomorrow afternoon."</p><p>Houston. The irony wasn't lost on him. He'd been close to her all this time and never known it.</p><p>"No," Ryan interjected. "I'll go. I'm already in Texas. I can be in Houston in a couple of hours."</p><p>There was a long silence over the phone. "Sir, it might not be her. I prefer to get confirmation before you take a needless trip."</p><p>"You said it was most likely her," Ryan said impatiently. "If it turns out not to be, I won't hold you responsible."</p><p>"Should I hold off my man then?"</p><p>Ryan paused, his lips tight, his grip on the phone even tighter. "If it's Kelly, I'll know. If it's not, I'll inform you so you can continue your search. There's no need for you to send anyone down. I'll go myself."</p><p>Ryan drove through Westheimer in the blinding rain. His destination was a small cafe in west Houston where Kelly was waitressing. It shouldn't surprise him. She'd been waitressing in a trendy New York cafe when they'd met. But the check he'd written her would have prevented her from needing to work for quite some time. He figured she would have returned to school. Even when they'd become engaged, she'd expressed the desire to finish her degree. He hadn't understood it, but he'd supported her decision. The selfish part of him had wanted her to be completely reliant on him.</p><p><i>Why hadn't she cashed the check?</i></p><p>He had hopped the ferry to Galveston immediately after giving Rafe and Bryony his best wishes. He hadn't told Cam or Dev that he'd found Kelly, just that he had an important business matter to attend to. By the time he'd gotten to Houston it had been late in the evening, so he'd spent a sleepless night in a downtown hotel.</p><p>When he'd gotten up this morning, the skies had been gray and overcast and there hadn't been a single break in the rain since he'd left his hotel. At least the weather had been beautiful for Rafe's wedding. By now the happy couple would be off on their honeymoon&#x2014;someplace where there was an abundance of blue skies.</p><p>He glanced over at his GPS and saw he was still several blocks from his destination. To his frustration, he hit every single red light on the way down the busy street. Why he was in a hurry, he didn't know.

In this revised edition, the author updates his rather gloomy predictions of thirty years ago that the Kachina rituals were in danger of dying out because modern pressures seemed to be restricting their worship. Despite the continual pressures of modern and Anglo ways of life, however, Dockstader can happily report that the Kachina has made a dramatic return and that Hopi religion remains a strong and meaningful foundation of the culture. In fact, Dockstader observes, the appreciation of the ancient Hopi rituals and traditional customs &#34;provides much of the glue holding together the whole Hopi world-- and of this, the Kachina remains a major element.&#34; Although anthropologists have long tried to systematize and interpret the Hopi Kachina cult, it is Dockstader who has brought the material up to date, fit it into its historical perspective, and described and explained the manifold symbols and designs from the viewpoint of the Hopi artist. The author examines the effects of the current surge of tourist interest in Indian traditions, especially dances, and the ever-growing art market interest in Kachina dolls. The influence of commercialization is clear, and some of the effects are inevitably deleterious. - &#34;The book contains a wealth of information on general Hopi history and Hopi life.&#34;--Harold Colton FREDERICK DOCKSTADER holds the Ph.D. in American Studies from Western Reserve University.

Between a manifesto and a tactical plan of action,&nbsp;<i>How Soon is Now?</i>&nbsp;by radical futurist and philosopher Daniel Pinchbeck outlines a vision for a mass social movement that will address this crisis.<br><br>Drawing on a huge range of resources and references Daniel Pinchbeck presents a compelling argument for the need for change on a global basis &#x2013; it is only when we see ourselves as one planetary tribe that this change can occur. The central thesis is that humanity has self-willed the ecological crisis in order to bring about the necessary conditions for transcendence of our current state of being, by undergoing an initiatory ordeal on a planetary scale. <br><br>This collective ordeal is necessary for us to evolve from one state of being &#x2013; our current level of consciousness &#x2013; to the next. By passing through this initiation we realize ourselves as one unified being, a planetary super-organism in a symbiotic relationship with the Earth's ecology and the entire web of life. Covering everything from energy and agriculture, to culture, politics, media and ideology, Pinchbeck's book is ultimately about the nature of the human soul and the future of our current world. He calls for an intentional and consciously designed metamorphosis of our current systems, which transform capitalist and exclusive structures into participatory, democratic, and inclusive ones, based on an integration of Eastern metaphysics, social ecology, and radical political thought.

However, his life and ministry were radically transformed by this three-word phrase:&nbsp;<em>life matters more</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>In essence,&nbsp;<em>Truth Matters, Life Matters More&nbsp;</em>is two books in one. Because truth matters, part 1 explicates the essentials of the Christian faith in a memorable way to equip readers to communicate Christian truth. In part 2, Hank explains why life matters more and how we can experience the height of human existence&#x2014;union with God. Simply put, the map is not the territory. The menu is not the meal. We cheat ourselves of unadulterated union with Christ when we elevate the message above the Messenger.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Truth Matters, Life Matters More&nbsp;</em>is a modern classic and the magnum opus of one of the great theological minds of our time. Prepare to discover the unexpected beauty of an authentic Christian life.</p></p><p><p>Hank Hanegraaff serves as president and chairman of the board of the North Carolina&#x2013;based Christian Research Institute. He is also host of a nationally syndicated radio broadcast, which is heard daily across the United States and Canada&#x2014;and around the world via the Internet at equip.org. Hank is the author of more than twenty books.&nbsp;</p> <p>Widely regarded as one of the world&#x2019;s leading Christian authors and apologists, Hank is deeply committed to equipping Christians to be so familiar with truth that when counterfeits loom on the horizon, they recognize them instantaneously. Through his live call-in broadcast, Hank answers questions on the basis of careful research and sound reasoning, and interviews today&#x2019;s most significant leaders and thinkers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hank and his wife, Kathy, live in Charlotte, North Carolina, and are parents to twelve children.</p>'Hank Hanegraaff's Truth Matters, Life Matters More is a remarkable tapestry of vast historical and scriptural knowledge, woven from personal experience, chronicles of faith journeys, and marvelous spiritual insights that mesh to create more than a compendium of theology. Indeed, he pulls the strands together with deftness and devotion, such that they form a map, a sacred topography of the life in Christ. And as a good cartographer would do, Hanegraaff makes sure that the reader has all the keys and legends to read his map. He knows how to point the reader in all the right directions, but he also knows that it is grace that 'will lead us home.'' Fr. Alex Karloutsos, Vicar General of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America<br><br>'Quoting from a wide range of sources, Hank Hanegraaff makes an impassioned case for calling the church back to her earliest roots in this book that is sure to stir and provoke any reader. Participation, union, and even the controversial word deification have been making a quiet comeback in the wake of more and more calls to broaden our collective understanding of what salvation entails. In this book, Hanegraaff wages a battle on two fronts. On the one hand, he wants to maintain that biblical truth matters. On the other hand, he insists that this truth is neither abstract nor impersonal, but a living truth because it is anchored in the living Christ. As someone passionately interested in recovering the reality of our union with Christ, I hope readers will thoughtfully engage with Hanegraaff's challenging conclusions.' Rankin Wilbourne, Pastor of Pacific Crossroads Church Los Angeles and author of Union with Christ and The Cross Before Me<br><br>'As Hank has masterfully pointed out, 'there can be no life without truth, but above all, no truth without life, deification is God's greatest gift. It is the high peak truth of redemptive revelation.' Hank elucidates this life-changing lesson revealing that 'while truth is necessary, it is hardly sufficient. That the map is not the territory. That the menu is not the meal. That we must never mistake the cradle for its occupant. And that we are destined even now to experience life that is life to the full.' This book will further allow us to take His life as source of our living, in our church life, for His satisfaction, to bring to light the Kingdom of God on earth.' Samuel Nee, a fellow lover and partaker of Christ, nephew of Watchman Nee<br><br>'Truth Matters, Life Matters More is a cornucopia of good, nourishing things, the fruit of Hank's many decades of reading, reflection, and prayer. His gift for taking in complex ideas, digesting them, and then presenting them to readers clearly and briefly make his latest book a wise companion and enjoyable friend.' Frederica Mathewes-Green, author of Welcome to the Orthodox Church: An Introduction to Eastern Christianity<br><br>'In this moving and compelling book, Hank Hanegraaff recapitulates the apologetic themes that he has spent decades honing and defending--from human origins, to the reality of the resurrection, to the reliability of Scripture. But, more than that, he shows how this vital defense of truth must be part of the larger cause of uniting our life with the life of God. This is a theme that for too long has been missed by millions of believing Christians. Hank shows, with characteristic precision, how the traditional Christian idea of 'deification' is not some doubtful sidelight, but represents the culmination of the Christian life, and the source of Christian unity. Whether you've read all of Hank's books, or none of them, I urge you to read this one.' Jay Richards, Ph.D., O.P., assistant research professor at the Catholic University of America, senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, executive editor of The Stream, and a New York Times bestselling author--his many books include the forthcoming Eat, Fast, Feast<br><br>'This book portrays what the flower of a beautiful life looks like when it blossoms from the rich soil of Christian truth. The author is widely read and theologically astute in his articulation of selected doctrines of classical Christian faith. The book instructs, inspires, and bears witness to a godly life that blooms from our union with the Incarnate God.' Bradley Nassif, Ph.D., Professor of Biblical and Theological Studies, North Park University, and co-editor of The Philokalia: A Classical Text of Orthodox Spirituality<br><br>'The truth here is that salvation is so much greater than most people allow themselves to believe. We have been saved not only FROM sin, but FOR divine life. God has shared his inner life with us and made us partakers of his divine nature. This book tells how the Bible Answer Man arrived at the Bible's most important answer.' Scott Hahn, Ph.D., Chair of Biblical Theology and the New Evangelization at Franciscan University of Steubenville<br><br>'Hank Hanegraaff's Truth Matters, Life Matters More is a wonderfully written reminder that we are made for more than merely knowing the truth about God--we are made to be Christ's brothers and sisters, and the Father's sons and daughters, through deification. This is a forgotten, deeply biblical truth that the early Christians well understood, and one that all Christians must recover.' Benjamin Wiker, Ph.D., author of many books including A Meaningful World and Professor of Political Science and Director of Human Life Studies at Franciscan University<br><br>'Hanegraaff's masterpiece guides us toward ultimate Truth in the context of Christ's promise that He has come to give us life--deified life that is life to the full.' Norris J. Chumley, Ph.D., author and Emmy Award-winning executive producer and director, Mysteries of the Jesus Prayer<br><br>'Truth Matters, Life Matters More details Hank Hanegraaff's life journey from his childhood to the present day, a voyage guided by Providence. Hanegraaff rightly recognizes salvation as a step towards a higher state--deification--which is not a reality to be expressed conceptually but lived out through the transformation of our life in Christ, through the Holy Spirit, by means of the grace communicated in the Church by the sacraments and the personal practice of spiritual disciplines. 'What makes Hanegraaff's approach interesting is that it is not a theoretical presentation but a testimony of his personal journey. Though Hank's reflections are rooted in personal experience, there is a clear desire for others to experience similar spiritual growth, exhibiting a youthful enthusiasm for evangelism. In traversing the stages of the long way that led him to True Life, he does not forget to pay homage to those who, often without knowing it, illumined his path.'

She retained her interest in knitting throughout the years, including during her period of service with the ATS both at home and abroad. She met her husband in Jerusalem and they married after the war. Their home was made in Perthshire, her husband's birthplace. They had two sons, both now married.

Rather than relying on the faulty memories of men who aren&#39;t entirely sure in what order their albums first appeared. Badman has trawled through newspaper archives and radio interviews, to recreate the group&#39;s response to events as they happened. The results are probably nearer the truth. Most telling are the press conference extracts, which capture the Fab&#39;s growing impatience with Beatlemania adn how contemporary interviews show group unity dissapating after &#39;66.&#39;</p><h2>God&#39;s Demon</h2><p>Lucifer's War, which damned legions of angels to Hell, is an ancient and bitter memory shrouded in the smoke and ash of the Inferno. The Fallen, those banished demons who escaped the full wrath of Heaven, have established a limitless and oppressive kingdom within the fiery confines of Hell. Lucifer has not been seen since the Fall and the mantle of rulership has been passed to the horrific Prince Beelzebub, the Lord of the Flies.&nbsp;The Demons Major, Heaven's former warriors, have become the ruling class.&nbsp;They are the equivalent to landed lords, each owing allegiance to the de facto ruler of&nbsp;Hell. They&nbsp;reign over their fiefdoms, tormenting the damned souls and adding to their wealth.<br><br>One Demon Major, however, who has not forgotten his former life in Heaven. The powerful Lord Sargatanas is restless. For millennia Sargatanas has ruled dutifully but unenthusiastically, building his city, Adamantinarx, into the model of an&nbsp;Infernal metropolis. But he has never forgotten what he lost in the Fall--proximity to God. He is sickened by what he has become.&nbsp;Now, with a small event--a confrontation with one of the damned souls--he makes a decision that will reverberate through every being in Hell. Sargatanas decides to attempt the impossible, to rebel, to endeavor to go Home and bring with him <i>anyone</i> who chooses to follow . . . be they demon or soul. He will stake everything on this chance for redemption.</p><p>Wayne Barlowe is an award-winning artist who has created paintings for<i> Life, Time, </i>and <i>Newsweek</i>. His bestselling book,<i> Barlowe&#x2019;s Guide to Extraterrestrials,</i> is a modern classic.Chapter 1<br>There was the Fall. And no one was permitted to speak of it, or of the time before or of the Above. But it was the Fall that established many things in Hell, not the least of which was the distribution of territory. The future wards of Hell were randomly determined as each Demon Major, on his own sizzling trajectory from the Above, plunged headlong, meteoric, into the unknown wilds of the Inferno. Some impacted far apart, setting up their realms in relative seclusion and safety, while others, less fortunate, found themselves in close proximity, able to see the rising smoke of their neighbor&#x2019;s arrival. These close arrivals began plotting and campaigning as soon as they could gather about them enough minor demons to form a court. The fratricidal wars that erupted lingered for millennia, occasionally flaring up into major conflagrations. These were the volatile times of Settlement and they were never forgotten by the survivors. Many of Lucifer&#x2019;s original Host were lost, but those that remained, the strong and the cunning, established powerful kingdoms that would grow and prosper.&nbsp;<br>When Eligor Fell he found himself upon a smoking plain cratered with the barely moving bodies of a thousand fallen demons. They lay, as he did, stunned, twisted by their furious descents, and glowing from myriad tiny embers. Eligor had been a foot soldier in the celestial Host, attached to the seraph Sargatanas&#x2019; legions, and could remember nothing of his final moments Above. Somehow, as he Fell, he had managed to stay near his general&#x2019;s flaming smoke-plume.<br>Eligor came upon Sargatanas as he stood upon a wind-whipped bluff, unsteady, the steam of his descent wreathing him. Transformed from luminous seraph to Demon Major, he had lost all of his heavenly trappings and none of his dignity. A corona of embers flitted away from his massive head and Eligor saw it form into a great and complicated sigil for the first time. Sargatanas had been one of the fortunate ones, a demon who had Fallen, uncontested, in an infernal region harsh and inhospitable, albeit rich in minerals and perfect for city-building. Glowing milky white upon a flat plain before them, and bending around a tall central mount, oxbowed a slow-flowing river that would be named Acheron. Here, Eligor somehow knew, a great city would rise.<br>They stood silently, watching the shower of fiery contrails, the paths of slower descents as they approached their new, unwelcoming home. Eligor glanced over at his lord. He saw Sargatanas looking up, beyond the contrails and beyond the clouds, and saw him close his burning eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;A great number of demons gathered about Sargatanas as he set about the founding of his city. The earliest, mostly unknown to him, were those who had descended nearby and, after meeting with him, agreed to join his van. Others traveling from afar, more often than not, had known him from before the Fall and wanted to be by his side, perhaps for comfort, in the new world.<br>Eligor&#x2019;s intuition had proven correct; Sargatanas had seen the same potential in the land near where he had Fallen. The boundaries of Sargatanas&#x2019; future city were vast, yet the Demon Major had walked them himself, pointing out to Eligor the specific features of the landscape that had provoked his interest in this particular spot. The great river, especially, had won Sargatanas over. As he and Eligor approached its steep banks, they smelled a distinct saltiness carried upon the thick air.<br>They peered down into the languorously flowing Acheron and both of them could see tiny forms, indistinct and writhing, in the thick water. An unaccountable deep sadness filled them as their lungs filled with the mist-laden air that rose up, and, after a moment, Sargatanas shook his great head and spun away. The gesture surprised Eligor, breaking the odd reverie that had fallen about him.<br>They left the river and ascended the gradual rise to the projected city&#x2019;s periphery where, standing assembled in a seemingly endless line twenty ranks deep, were countless souls. They were a miserable, deformed crowd, crying and trembling, as yet unaware of what was going to befall them. Sargatanas drew himself up, smoothing his robes as he walked toward them, deaf to the echoing pleas that filled the air. Eligor, too, ignored them, grown accustomed, as he was, to the souls&#x2019; ways.<br>They were the first arrivals, souls who had been sent as the vanguard of humanities&#x2019; effluvia, the damned. A steady stream of them had been arriving since shortly after the demons&#x2019; Fall, and while he was repulsed by them and their ways, Eligor found himself fascinated nonetheless.<br>Their appearance was as grotesque as their croaking chorus; they were as varied and individual as the capricious laws of the demons could create. Somewhere in Hell, somewhere Eligor would never visit, a veritable army of lesser demons had their way with the endless flood of souls as they entered the realm. Legless, headless, corkscrewed, folded, torn, and pierced, each soul wore but the thinnest mask of mankind. No two were alike. And pushed, as if into gray clay by a giant&#x2019;s hand, into each soul was a black sphere, heavy and dull. Sargatanas told Eligor that the Demons Major had fashioned these globes, filled with the essence of the souls&#x2019; transgressions, to serve not only as reminders of their punishment but also as a means for the demons&#x2019; control. Beyond that he did not say, but Eligor marveled at the simplicity of it. As he and Sargatanas passed them, Eligor looked into their fog-white eyes and wondered what they knew, whether there was any remnant at all of their previous lives to be found in the gray husks.<br>Sargatanas approached his new Architect General, greeting him warmly. The Demon Major Halphas, thin and flamboyantly spined, was bedecked in layers of clacking, bone-ornamented robes while above his head blazed his new sigil, an elaborate device that now incorporated the sigil of his liege, Sargatanas, as well. Halphas was smiling as his lord approached. Around him were a half-dozen other demons, his assistants, each of whom looked at their lord with anticipatory pleasure.<br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; Halphas said dramatically, his smile revealing through his destroyed cheeks myriad tiny teeth, &#x201c;we await but your command and the walls&#x2019; foundations will be laid.&#x201d;<br>Sargatanas examined the deep trench and took the maps from Halphas, comparing what he could see with the glyph-dense diagrams that appeared on the chart. He nodded and handed them over to Eligor, who studied them briefly.<br>&#x201c;You have done a flawless job, Lord Halphas. It is obvious to me how much effort went into your careful plans. And I checked the city limits; they are just as I laid out without the slightest deviation. Excellent!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lord, I am pleased,&#x201d; Halphas said modestly in his scratchy voice. &#x201c;The Overseers only await your command.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We cannot begin soon enough,&#x201d; said Sargatanas. He raised his faintly steaming hand and with a small gesture, a flick of his hand, created a simple fiery glyph that immediately fractured and sped off to the many attending demons. They, in their turn, dutifully produced their own glyphs that rose into the sky, and these, flying along the outline of the wall, galvanized the distant demons who began the process of converting souls into bricks. The wailing grew in intensity, but none of the demons paid it any attention. Conscious of their lord&#x2019;s presence, they were too intent upon beginning the job at hand, as the wall&#x2019;s foundation started to take form around them.<br>Eligor watched in amazement; this was the first time he had witnessed any real construction in Hell. The techniques, he knew, were relatively untried. As each glittering glyph touched a selected soul upon its black sphere it would instantly transform from a solid globe into a thick, black liquid that flowed down into the ground. And even as the liquid began to pool, the glyph&#x2019;s true meaning impacted upon the soul, hammering it, compressing it into a brick, wringing out what little blood there might be, and then sending it tumbling into position in the wall. Silencing its cries forever. And upon each brick, stamped in relief into its wrinkled surface, was the sigil of its lord, Sargatanas.<br>Black and oily Scourges, demon-tamed Abyssals that flapped their short wings and cracked their cranium-mounted whips, darted about keeping the quavering souls in line. Eligor loathed the Scourges but had to admit their effectiveness. Pressed closely together, the clay-colored souls reacted to the commencement of construction in various ways. Some collapsed, some knelt sobbing, while others, wide-eyed, looked stunned and seemed unable to move. Most stood and pleaded at the top of their voices while a few desperate individuals attempted to run, though Eligor, who was watching all this intently, could not imagine where they thought they would go. Time and again, he would watch the well-trained Scourges fly away in short pursuits, mindlessly flailing the fleeing souls until they collapsed. Once they were still, the souls were hooked and brought back to the trench&#x2019;s edge. None ever escaped.<br>The Overseers, arms outstretched, repeatedly created their conversion-glyphs with such rapidity that the overall impression of the growing wall was one of a luminous ribbon of twinkling fire, a radiant necklace set upon the dark bosom of Hell.<br>The Overseers were, under Halphas&#x2019; able tutelage, extremely skilled; it took enormous concentration to create, size, and shape the bricks and set them in place quickly, and some of the demons openly competed with their neighbors, racing to complete their sections.<br>The broad trench filled smoothly and efficiently. Huge gaps were left for the seven massive gates that would be built. Halphas&#x2019; calculations were perfection; Sargatanas had said many times that he thought him the best architect in Hell. As a raw material the souls were malleable and&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;plentiful. A hundred souls every foot created the beginnings of a wall twenty feet thick and ten feet high&#x2014;nothing compared to what the finished wall would be, but a start nonetheless.<br>Eventually, as the numbers of standing souls diminished, the wailing tapered off to be replaced by the low moan of the hot winds. Algol was setting; the long day&#x2019;s work was done. More souls would be collected, more wall would be created, and eventually this moment would become nothing but a distant memory for demon and brick alike.<br>When all was done for the day, Sargatanas walked along the fresh foundation for some distance, hands behind his back, inspecting the site. He was smiling broadly. His city would be built, and this ceremony was its harbinger. His elation was unmistakable, and Eligor and the others could not help but be swept up in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Eligor watched with growing wonder and enthusiasm as Adamantinarx-upon-the-Acheron rose, layer by layer, like a dark, growing crystal from the fleshy ground. As a moon is to a sun, so was Adamantinarx to the cities of Heaven. Under the guiding hand of Sargatanas, the city&#x2019;s planners did their best with the materials at hand to emulate the splendor of the Above. Eligor suspected that those similarities in architecture were born merely out of the desire of the demon planners to live as they had and not meant to be a cynical parody of a lost world. At times, as he walked the growing streets, Eligor felt at ease, even at home. But at other moments, moments when the memories of his former life came to him, the dark evocation made him sad.<br>The great hunts that Sargatanas organized to rid the nearby Wastes of the Abyssal fauna and the Primordial natives would help cheer Eligor at these times. It was impossible for him to not share the wild exhilaration that everyone felt, charging through the chaotic landscape after the fearless wildlife, and he would soon forget his sadness. The indigenous creatures of Hell posed a continuing threat to the construction of Adamantinarx, and it was challenging, even for former angels, to run them down and destroy them.<br>The city grew quickly and was populated just as quickly. There was no shortage of ready inhabitants. Hell, Eligor thought often, would never have a problem filling its cities. Soon not only demon workers but demons of all description as well as gray, twisted souls by the hundreds of thousands strode the broad avenues dwarfed by the enormous buildings; the only requirement to existing within the city&#x2019;s boundaries was fealty to Sargatanas&#x2019; bidding.<br>And when Adamantinarx had grown for ten thousand years, the two demons had found themselves together, surveying the great city from one of its lofty towers. Eligor, in a moment of sincere enthusiasm, had turned to Sargatanas and said, &#x201c;This exile, my lord, has not been nearly as grievous as we had, at first, thought. So much has been achieved!&#x201d;<br>Sargatanas looked at him and said, &#x201c;But Eligor, this is only the beginning of the beginning.&#x201d;<br>Sargatanas&#x2019; voice, all harmonics and rumbles like the woody intake of some giant pipe organ, had sounded sardonic. Eligor had no reply for his lord. They had spent so much time in Hell already. Eligor would always look back at that small conversation as the moment when the enormity of their banishment&#x2014;of their shared eternity&#x2014;crystallized.<br>Perhaps, Eligor had thought during this early period, this is why there is such frenetic building. Like beasts who groom themselves when confronted with the insoluble, the demons, confronted with the eternity of their damnation, built. What else could they do but attempt to make this place their own? If they had to live in this place forever, they would try to tame it first, make it their own. But he knew that Hell could not be brought to heel. It was a living place, a place with its own will.<br>Sargatanas went about his tasks with a preternatural intensity that bordered on the obsessive. He never tired of directing the large and small matters of state. It was, Eligor guessed, his way of not thinking about the reality of their situation. He seemed, too, to be preoccupied with the affairs of his neighboring fiefdoms. The lands of his mentor from before the Fall, Lord Astaroth, bordered his largest ward, and this pleased him. Astaroth was old, genial, perhaps a little inept in his governing, and Sargatanas looked with some dismay at his old teacher&#x2019;s failures. But, in those early days, he posed no threat to Sargatanas or his realm and peace reigned.<br>Adamantinarx was not dissimilar, in its composition, from many of the cities of Hell; its flagstoned streets ran red with the blood of its souls, its soul-bricks sighed and blinked as one passed them, and its countless low buildings groaned and shuddered like any others in any other infernal city. But it was also the least tortured of Hell&#x2019;s cities, and its underlying openness was due solely to Sargatanas&#x2019; will. Just as Hell&#x2019;s capital, Dis, was a horrific reflection of its creator, Beelzebub, Adamantinarx seemed, to its demonic inhabitants, as tolerant as its lord. There was a difference, a nobility, to this demon. Eligor could see it, as could any who entered Sargatanas&#x2019; court. When he laid the foundations, high atop the center mount, for his many-bastioned palace, he consulted not only with Halphas but also with each of his chief underlings. Eligor saw how this openhandedness affected the court, how it served not only to bring together each demon but also to make them loyal to Sargatanas.<br>During one such consultation, high atop the ...</p><h2>Christian Studies IV, Teacher Manual</h2><p>After completing Memoria Press' <i>Christian Studies I-III</i>, we felt students needed a good review to solidify all of the information they have learned, so we wrote one. <i>Christian Studies IV</i> takes students back through the highlights of the Bible, reviewing drill questions, Scripture memory passages, and more!

Not since, the Bombay of &#34;Midnight&#39;s Children&#34; have a time and place been so intensely and accurately captured in a novel. &#34;Fury&#34; opens on a New York living at breakneck speed in an age of unprecedented decadence. Malik Solanka, a Cambridge-educated self-made millionaire originally from Bombay, arrives looking, perversely, for escape. This former philosophy professor is the inventor of the hugely popular doll, Little Brain, whose multiform ubiquity - as puppet, cartoon and masked woman - now rankles with him. He becomes frustratingly estranged from his own creation. At the same time, his marriage is disintegrating: it escalates into a rage-filled battle, and Solanka very nearly commits an unforgiveable act. Horrified by the fury within him, he flees home and family and becomes a sort of spiritual mendicant - except that he has a credit card and a duplex on the Upper West Side. Solanka discovers that he has come to a city roiling with anger, where cab drivers spout invective and a serial killer is murdering women with a lump of concrete, a metropolis whose population is united by petty spats and bone-deep resentment. His own thoughts, emotions and desires, meanwhile, are also running wild.</p><p><i>Fury</i> is a gloss on fin-de-si�cle angst from the master of the quintuple entendre. Salman Rushdie hauls his hero, Malik Solanka, from Bombay to London to New York, and finally to a fictional Third World country, all in order to show off a preternatural ability to riff on anything from Bollywood musicals to revolutionary politics. Professor Solanka is propelled on this path by his strange love of dolls. He plays with them as a child; as an adult he quits his post at Cambridge in order to produce a TV show wherein an animated doll, Little Brain, meets the great thinkers of history. Little Brain becomes a smash hit, and perhaps inevitably, Solanka finds himself in America. (It's not only the show-biz version of manifest destiny that brings him to the New World: one night in London he finds himself standing over the sleeping figures of his beloved wife and child, frighteningly close to stabbing them. This intellectual puppeteer is, of course, fleeing himself.)<p> Now, in New York, he is filled with wrath. Solanka is far from being an Everyman, but his fury is a kind of Everyfury. It's road rage writ large--the natural reaction to an excess of mental traffic. There are several books running simultaneously here: a mystery, a family romance, a bitingly satirical portrait of millennial Manhattan, and a sci-fi revolutionary fantasy. A single fragment gives a sense of Rushdie's reflexive multiplicity: when Solanka finally faces his memories of childhood, he recalls "his damn Yoknapatawpha, his accursed Malgudi." Here's a writer who, leading us into the tender places of his protagonist's soul, stops long enough to reference not just Faulkner but Narayan as well. If it sounds like a bit of a mess, it is. If it sounds frighteningly intelligent, it's that too. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>"Life is fury. Fury-sexual, Oedipal, political, magical, brutal- drives us to our finest heights and coarsest depths. This is what we are, what we civilize ourselves to disguise-the terrifying human animal in us, the exalted, transcendent, self-destructive, untrammeled lord of creation. We raise each other to the heights of joy. We tear each other limb from bloody limb." <br>Malik Solanka, historian of ideas and dollmaker extraordinaire, steps out of his life one day, abandons his family without a word of explanation, and flees London for New York. There's a fury within him, and he fears he has become dangerous to those he loves. He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America's wealth and power, seeking to "erase" himself. Eat me, America, he prays, and give me peace.<br>But fury is all around him. Cabdrivers spout invective. A serial killer is murdering women with a lump of concrete. The petty spats and bone-deep resentments of the metropolis engulf him. His own thoughts, emotions, and desires, meanwhile, are also running wild. A tall, green-eyed young blonde in a D'Angelo Voodoo baseball cap is in store for him. As is another woman, with whom he will fall in love and be drawn toward a different fury, whose roots lie on the far side of the world.<br> <b>Fury</b> is a work of explosive energy, at once a pitiless and pitch-black comedy, a profoundly disturbing inquiry into the darkest side of human nature, and a love story of mesmerizing force. It is also an astonishing portrait of New York.

Sentenced to ten years in a Siberian penal colony on fraud and tax evasion charges, he was put on trial again in 2010 and sentenced to fourteen years, despite the fact that the new charges contradicted the earlier ones.&nbsp; While imprisoned, Khodorkovsky fought for the rights of his fellow prisoners, going on hunger strike four times. After he was pardoned in 2013, he vowed to continue fighting for prisoners&#x2019; rights, and My Fellow Prisoners is a tribute to that work.

Over the next two centuries, as Spanish and French expeditions explored the state, they recorded detailed information about the locations and lifeways of Texas's Native peoples. Using recent translations of these expedition diaries and journals, along with discoveries from ongoing archaeological investigations, William C. Foster here assembles the most complete account ever published of Texas's Native peoples during the early historic period (AD 1528 to 1722).</p><p>Foster describes the historic Native peoples of Texas by geographic regions. His chronological narrative records the interactions of Native groups with European explorers and with Native trading partners across a wide network that extended into Louisiana, the Great Plains, New Mexico, and northern Mexico. Foster provides extensive ethnohistorical information about Texas's Native peoples, as well as data on the various regions' animals, plants, and climate. Accompanying each regional account is an annotated list of named Indian tribes in that region and maps that show tribal territories and European expedition routes.</p><p>This authoritative overview of Texas's historic Native peoples reveals that these groups were far more cosmopolitan than previously known. Functioning as the central link in the continent-wide circulation of trade goods and cultural elements such as religion, architecture, and lithic technology, Texas's historic Native peoples played a crucial role in connecting the Native peoples of North America from the Pacific Coast to the Southeast woodlands.</p></p><p>An award-winning historian and fellow of the Texas State Historical Association, WILLIAM C. FOSTER is the author of Spanish Expeditions into Texas, 1689-1768 and editor of Texas and Northeastern Mexico, 1630-1690 by Juan Bautista Chapa.</p><h2>Moondust Lake (Miramar Bay)</h2><p><i>What to do with a life where everything he&#x2019;s worked for is shattered?</i><br>&nbsp;<br>A top executive in the family business, Buddy Helms lives and works under the thumb of his powerful father. He&#x2019;s proved himself time and again to the manipulative patriarch&#x2014;even saving the company from financial ruin. Yet for six years Buddy&#x2019;s waited to hear that he&#x2019;s worthy of his father&#x2019;s love and respect.

More than 2500 heraldic entries offer brief, biographical data and list descendants and siblings, collateral branches, and predecessors. The addition of adopted children and those born out of wedlock, a relatively new phenomenon, ensures a more inclusive scope. Illustrations in black and white include coats of arms, medals, insignia, royal crowns, and coronets. The arrangement is in chapters, with two main sections, compiled alphabetically, supplying information on peerage and baronetage. A third chapter addresses the royal family in depth. In addition, the volume provides tables of precedence, a guide to the wearing of orders, articles on the Orders of Knighthood and Chivalry and the Order of Successions, among others, and a record of extinct, dormant, aberrant, and disclaimed titles. The work records changes since 1995 in the form of births, deaths, and marriages. For example, the deaths of 109 hereditary and 78 life peers have caused 13 titles to become dormant or extinct, while 210 replacements have been created. A reference classic similar to John Bernard Burke's Burke's Peerage &amp; Baronetage (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999) and useful as a record of British aristocracy, this pricey source will appeal only to select individuals.

Traveling from the mountains of Tibet to the jungles of the Amazon, Davis delves into the mysteries of shamanic healing, experiences first-hand hallucinogenic plants, explores the vanishing Borneo rain forests, and describes the ingenuity of the Inuit as they hunt narwhale on the Arctic ice.<br><br>A compelling and utterly unique celebration of the beauty and diversity of our planet, <b>Shadows in the Sun</b> is about landscape and character, the wisdom of lives drawn directly from the land, and the hunger of those who seek to rediscover such understanding. Davis shows that preserving the diversity of the world's cultures and spiritual beliefs is as important as preserving endangered plants and animals--and vital to our understanding of who we are.</p><p>Renowned anthropologist Wade Davis shows us how preserving the diversity of the world's cultures and spiritual beliefs is just as important as preserving our endangered plants, insects, and animals. In this collection of personal essays, Davis tells of dramatic personal adventures during which he visits and often lives with indigenous communities in the remote regions of the world. He offers reports of toad-smoking shamanistic journeys in the Amazon forests, tracking an elusive cloud leopard in the mountains of Tibet, and a soulful lament for the lost American buffalo.<p> Although he has been called a modern-day Indiana Jones, Davis has far more integrity. His stories are not in service to self-glorification, but rather to one resounding theme: </p><blockquote>If there is one lesson I have drawn from my travels, it is that cultural and biological diversity are far more than the foundation of stability; they are an article of faith, a fundamental truth that indicates the way things are supposed to be.... There is a fire burning over the Earth, taking with it plants and animals, cultures, languages, ancient skills, and visionary wisdom. Quelling this flame and reinventing the poetry of diversity is the most important challenge of our times.</blockquote> <i>--Gail Hudson</i>"The wonders of the diversity of various cultures are hunted, gathered, and appreciated here--Davis's lovely, cubist, rich landscape portraits are topographies of spirit, conveying a sense of the music of place."<br>--Kirkus Reviews<br><br> "Delightful. . . .

Now, in Brunswick Gardens, she explores the controversial birth of a philosophy that enflamed fiery debate--and possibly murder.<br><br>A century ago, Charles Darwin's revolutionary theory of evolution rocked the civilized world, and the outraged Anglican church went on the warpath against it. In a mansion in London's affluent Brunswick Gardens, the battle is intense, as that most respected clergyman, the Reverend Ramsay Parmenter, is boldly challenged by his beautiful assistant, Unity Bellwood--a "new woman" whose feminism and aggressive Darwinism he finds appalling.<br><br>When Unity, three months pregnant, tumbles down the Parmenter staircase to her death, Thomas Pitt, commander of the Bow Street police station, is virtually certain that one of the three deeply devout men in the house committed murder. Could it have been the Reverend Parmenter, his handsome curate, or his Roman Catholic son? Powerful forces demand that the scandalous matter be cleared up immediately. But Pitt and his clever wife, Charlotte, refuse to settle for less than the truth . . . and justice.<br><br>Like all Anne Perry's novels, Brunswick Gardens translates great moral issues into deeply moving human dramas. Perhaps the most psychologically penetrating book she has written, it is a distinguished addition to her acclaimed body of work.</p><p><br>There are two times a year that I especially love. One is in October when Anne Perry's latest book featuring William Monk is published and the other is in April when her latest book in the Thomas Pitt series is published. I feel lucky that one of my most favorite writers manages to write two books a year.<p>I have worked with Anne Perry for nine years. She was one of the first authors whose books I publicized when I came to Ballantine, and ever since then my goal has been to get readers throughout the nation to read her work. What makes it especially fun for me is that I am not the only fan in my family. My mother loves to read her as does my sister-in-law and my godmother and my brother's mother-in-law. so there are always plenty of people to talk with about her books. And believe me her books always make you want to talk about a particular issue. Perry is an expert on the Victorian era -- an era that interests many of us. My interest in London began many years ago when I read Charles Dickens. And like Dickens, Perry's books are more than just mysteries each title deals with an important social issue that is still relevant today. It is interesting to me that people's crimes and sins today are really no different from what they were a century ago. The characters in Perry's books -- Monk, Pitt, Charlotte, Hester, Gracie, Emily, Aunt Vespasia, Oliver Rathbone -- are fascinating. It is so fun to go to book signings with Anne and hear fans discuss their favorite characters and wonder what is next for them. The way fans talk about them you would think these characters were real people.<br>Kim Hovey, VP &amp; Director of Publicity</p>Among Anne Perry's other novels featuring Thomas and Charlotte Pitt are Pentecost Alley, Traitors Gate, The Hyde Park Headsman, Highgate Rise, and Ashworth Hall, which was a Main Selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club. She also writes the popular novels featuring investigator William Monk, including The Silent Cry, a Main Selection of the Mystery Guild, Weighed in the Balance, Cain His Brother, and Defend and Betray.

The book offers a thesis which argues, for example, that the guillotine acts as an enlightenment machine, as the begetter of a new physiology of the headless body politic, as an aristocratic/democratic art of dying, and as the source of a new kind of criminological portraiture.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchThis rather curious book is more an evocation of an era than a revelation of new information. Arasse culls numerous first-hand accounts of the French Revolution to find out how contemporaries viewed the guillotine. Dr. Guillotin proposed that this machine should become a more humane form of executing criminals, but even before the Reign of Terror commenced the guillotine came to be associated with savagery. Arasse shows how every aspect of the ordeal (the procession, the scaffold, the final words of the accused, the actions of the executioner, as well as the guillotine's changing location) reveal important political and emotional details. By studying the public symbolism associated with the guillotine, this book helps the reader to gain an intimate appreciation of the drama of the Revolution. It should appeal to general readers as well as scholars.<br><i>- Thomas J.

Just follow the sign to the beach, where a bunch of fun-loving crabs, lounging dogs, gleeful insects, and bewildered-looking snails obligingly offer their feet for counting in a number of silly, surprising combinations - from one to one hundred!</p><p>April Pulley Sayre and Jeff Sayre are a husband-and-wife team who lead ecotours and travel extensively to study, photograph, and videotape animals in the rain forests of Panama, Madagascar, and Ecuador. They also speak at schools, botanical gardens, zoos, and nature festivals. Together they wrote a natural history book for adults. Jeff Sayre is an ecologist specializing in native plants and birds. April Pulley Sayre is an award-winning author of more than forty books for children. The Sayres love to brainstorm and laugh together - which is how the idea for ONE IS A SNAIL came about.<br>Randy Cecil graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design and is the illustrator of numerous books for children. He says of ONE IS A SNAIL, "It was great fun to figure out how these strange creatures would react in all these different combinations. Crabs seem to have the best time together!"PreSchool-Grade 2-The Sayres offer readers a fresh look at counting with a simple concept: the number of feet different animals have. The book begins with a snail's one foot, and then moves on to 2 for humans, 4 for dogs, 6 for insects, 8 for spiders, and 10 for crabs. Each odd number is represented by the even-numbered animal plus one snail. After 10, the numbers go by 10s to 100, with the number shown in two ways, for example: "70 is seven crabs- or ten insects and a crab. 80 is eight crabs- or ten spiders." All the animals are pictured on the beach, where most of them are involved in typical actions for their species; the fun-loving, playful crabs, however, bicycle, dance underwater limbo, play volleyball, and try new diversions on almost every page. Very simple text in large type is appropriate for group use as well as beginning readers. Uncluttered, black-outlined, oil-on-paper pictures clearly illustrate the concepts, and Cecil's googly-eyed snails, sports-minded crabs, and other animals add a touch of humor. Whether used with children just beginning to count or grade schoolers starting to multiply, this original and clever book will have wide appeal.<br><i>Louise L. Sherman, formerly at Anna C.

This spare, piercing, and unforgettable novel bridges two centuries and two intense love stories as Hannah and Conary&#39;s fate is interwoven with the tale of a marriage that took place in Dundee a hundred years earlier.</p><p><p>Beth Gutcheon is the critically acclaimed author of the novels, <em>The New Girls</em>, <em>Still Missing</em>, <em>Domestic Pleasures</em>, <em>Saying Grace</em>, <em>Five Fortunes</em>, <em>More Than You Know</em>, <em>Leeway Cottage</em>, and <em>Good-bye and Amen</em>. She is the writer of several film scripts, including the Academy-Award nominee <em>The Children of Theatre Street</em>. She lives in New York City.</p><p>My children think I'm mad to come up here in winter, but this is the only place I could tell this story. They think the weather is too cold for me, and the light is so short this time of year. It's true this isn't a story I want to tell in darkness. It isn't a story I want to tell at all, but neither do I want to take it with me.</p><p>If you approach Dundee, Maine, from inland by daylight, you see that you're traveling through wide reaches of pasture strewn with boulders, some of them great gray hulks as big as a house. You can feel the action of some vast mass of glacier scraping and gouging across the land, scarring it and littering it with granite detritus. The thought of all that ice pressing against the land makes you understand the earth as warm, living, and indestructible. Changeable, certainly. It was certainly changed by the ice. But it's the ice that's gone, and grass blows around the boulders, and lichens, green and silver, grow on them somehow like warm vegetable skin over the rock. Even rock, cold compared to earth, is warm and living, compared to the ice.</p><p>For miles and miles, the nearer you draw to the sea, the more the road climbs; I always think it must have been hard on the horses. Finally you reach the shoulder of Butter Hill, and then you are tipped suddenly down the far slope into the town. My heart moves every time I see that tiny brave and lovely cluster of bare white houses against the blue of the bay.</p><p></p><p>The earliest settlers in Dundee didn't come from inland; they came from the sea. It was far easier to sail downwind, even along that drowned coastline of mountains, whose peaks form the islands and ledges where boats land or founder, than to make your way by land. In many parts of the coast the islands were settled well before the mainland. This was particularly true of Great Spruce Bay, where Beal Island lies, a long tear-shaped mass in the middle of the bay, and where Dundee sits at the head of the innermost harbor.</p><p>Not much is known about the first settlement on Beat Island, except that a seventeenth-century hermit named Beat either chose it or was cast away there, and trapped and fished alone near the south end until, one winter, he broke his leg and died. Later, several families took root on the island and a tiny community grew near March Cove. Around 1760 a man named Crocker moved his wife and children from Beal onto the main to build a sawmill where the stream flows into the bay. The settlement there flourished and was sometimes called Crocker's Cove, or sometimes Friends' Cove, or Roundyville, after the early families who lived there. In the 1790s, the town elected to call the place Sunbury, and proudly sent Jacob Roundy down to Boston to file papers of incorporation (as Maine was then a territory of Massachusetts). When he got back, Roundy explained that the whole long way south on muleback he'd had a hymn tune in his head. The tune was Dundee and he'd decided this was a sign from God. "God moves in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform: He plants his footsteps in the sea, and rides upon the storm" went the first verse. The sentiment was hard to quarrel with, though there were those who were spitting mad, especially Abner Crocker, who had to paint out the word SUNBURY on the sign he had made to mark the town line, and for years and years faint ghosts of the earlier letters showed through behind the word DUNDEE.</p><p>There are small but thriving island settlements on the coast of Maine, even now. On Swans, Isle au Haut, Frenchboro, Vinalhaven, the Cranberry Isles. But no one lives on Beal Island anymore. Where there were open meadows and pastures a hundred years ago, now are masses of black-green spruce and fir and Scotch pine, interrupted by alder scrub. Summer people go out there for picnics and such, and so do people from the town, and so did I sixty years ago, but I'll never go again.</p><p>Traces of the town have disappeared almost completely, though it's been gone so short a time. Yet the island has been marked and changed by human habitation, as Maine meadows inland were altered by ancient ice. Something remains of the lives that were lived there. When hearts swell and hearts break, the feelings that filled them find other homes than human bodies, as moss deprived of earth can live on rock.</p><p>When my children were little, they used to pester Kermit Horton, down at the post office, to tell about the night he was riding past Friends' Comer and the ghost of a dead girl got right up behind him on his horse and rode with him from the spot where she died till he reached the graveyard. I'd heard Kermit tell that story quite a few times. When someone asked him who the girl was, and how she died, he usually said that no one knew, though once he told a summer visitor she'd been eaten by hogs.</p><p>I didn't know Kermit when I was very little and made brief visits to my grandparents. But I remember him well from that summer Edith brought me and my brother back to Dundee. And I remember Bowdoin Leach. Bowdoin liked me; he always told me he had been fond of my mother. I was seventeen that year, and I needed the kindness. Bowdoin was bent with arthritis, but he was still running his blacksmith shop out in the shed behind his niece's house. There were some who didn't care to talk about Beal Island, where he had grown up. Bowdoin seemed to like to, if asked the right way. </p></p><h2>Paddle Your Own Canoe: An Illustrated Guide to the Art of Canoeing</h2><p><p> The most comprehensive canoeing techniques book ever is now available for the first time in paperback. </p><p> Illustrated with 600 full-color photographs, this wide-ranging book is designed with both beginner and seasoned canoeists in mind.

Memories of Bonnemort have sustained him through four years of war, but when at last he comes home, he finds his world in tatters. The house has been abandoned, a family servant has been shot, Theo?s wife has been accused of collaborating, and a Nazi officer has been found dead in front of Bonnemort?s front gate. To save his sanity, Theo must restore order to Bonnemort, but first he must understand the disorder into which it has fallen. Is his wife a whore? A murderer? Or could there be another alternative?</p><p>British author Ironside (<i>Death in the Garden</i>) convincingly depicts the trauma of life in Vichy France in her compelling second novel. In 1944, after the Allied liberation, Theo de Cazalle, who faked his death four years earlier and joined the French Resistance, returns to his remote country estate, Bonnemort, where someone has slit the throat of a German officer and dumped the naked corpse in front of the house. De Cazalle suspects his wife, Ariane, believed to have betrayed her countrymen by becoming the Nazi's mistress, of the murder. Through flashbacks, which include Ariane's perspective as well as that of a Jewish schoolgirl Ariane has rescued and is concealing, Ironside deftly presents the powerlessness of her characters and the hard moral compromises they have to make to survive. Finally, amid multiple horrors and personal sacrifices, the author succeeds in making the fate of a beloved farm animal moving. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The route chosen by Colin Thubron passes through China, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey, taking in the most sterile desert on earth (the Taklamakan) and the strife-torn mountain valleys of today's conflicts, as he travels from the tomb of the Yellow Emperor (the mythic progenitor of the Chinese people) to the ancient port of Antioch, by local bus, truck, car -- occasionally Landrover, horse or camel. He covers 7,000 miles in 8 months, and confesses that it is the most difficult, complex and ambitious journey he has undertaken in 40 years of travel.<br><br>The Silk Road is a huge network of arteries and veins, splitting and converging across the breadth of Asia. Chinese silk has turned up in the hair of a 10th-century-BC Egyptian mummy; equally, the tartan plaids of 3000-year-old mummies in the Chinese desert echo those of early Celts. To be travelling the Silk Road, writes Colin Thubron, is to be travelling the history of the world: tracing the passage not just of trade and armies, but of ideas, religions and inventions. Yet -- despite the lure of the history -- this book is as much about Asia today. Its themes include different Islams (oppressed in China; fervent in Afghanistan and Iran; cautiously monitored in Uzbekistan); contrast (no cities could be more different than ancient Samarkand and modern Teheran); and the way that today's borders are meaningless because the true boundaries are made by tribe, ethnicity, language and religion.<br><br><b>Shadow of the Silk Road</b> is a brilliant account of an ancient world in modern ferment.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Colin Thubron was born in London in 1939. He left publishing to travel -- mainly in Asia and North Africa, where he made documentary films which were shown on BBC and world television. Afterwards, he returned to the Middle East, and wrote five books on the Area. In 1984, the Book Marketing Council nominated him one of the twenty best contemporary writers on travel.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>Jonathan Keeble gives a superb reading of this captivating account of a 7,000-mile, eight-month journey from Xian, China, to Antioch, Turkey, along the ancient silk route. Traveling by foot, camel, taxi, truck, train, and cart, Thubron sleeps in yurts, mud huts, vermin-infested inns, and six-bunk train compartments as he traces the route�s history and encounters its present. Speaking Mandarin, Russian, and English, he talks with a colorful array of locals belonging to many countries, tribes, clans, and religious groups. Keeble captures the conversations vividly and paces the reading so that listeners hear every exhausted step, rail at each bribe-hungry petty bureaucrat, and thrill to the magnificence of the scenery. An amazing adventure, expertly told.

But, as Matthew Mindrup shows, the uses of physical architectural models extend beyond mere representation. An architectural model can also simulate, instruct, inspire, and generate architectural designs. It can be, among other things, sign, souvenir, toy, funerary object, didactic tool, medium, or muse. In this book, Mindrup surveys the history of architectural models by investigating their uses, both theoretical and practical.</p><p>Tracing the architectural model's development from antiquity to the present, Mindrup also offers an interpretive framework for understanding each of its applications in the context of time and place. He first examines models meant to portray extant, fantastic, or proposed structures, describing their use in ancient funerary or dedicatory practices, in which models are endowed with magical power; as a medium for architectural reverie and inspiration; and as prototypes for twentieth-century experimental designs. Mindrup then considers models that exemplify certain architectural uses, exploring the influence of Leon Battista Alberti's dictum that models be simple, lest they distract from the architect's ideas; analyzing the model as a generative tool; and investigating allegorical, analogical, and anagogical interpretations of models.</p><p>Mindrup's histories show how the model can be a surrogate for the architectural structure itself, or for the experience of its formal, tactile, and sensory complexity; and beyond that, that the manipulation, play, experimentation, and dreaming enabled by models allow us to imagine architecture in new ways.</p></p><p>Matthew Mindrup is Senior Lecturer in the University of Sydney's School of Architecture, Design, and Planning. He is the author of <i>The Material Imagination: Reveries on Architecture and Matter</i>.<p>This erudite and profusely illustrated account of the multiple meanings and uses of physical architectural models in human history, from miniature to full scale, for purposes of memorializing, teaching, production, or inspiration, is particularly welcome at a time when the use of such material models tends to be obliterated from design practices. The engaging stories in this book foreground the importance of the material imagination in the creation of culturally specific constructions that nevertheless resonate with our universal human dreams.</p>&#x2015;<b>Alberto P�rez-G�mez</b>, Bronfman Professor of the History of Architecture at McGill University; author of&nbsp;<i>Attunement: Architectural Meaning after the Crisis of Modern Science</i><br><br><p>Plain and simple&nbsp;may characterize the architecture models recommended by Leon Battista Alberti, but other terms are needed for the miniatures, prototypes, exemplars, and muses assembled in this thematically argued and beautifully illustrated history: instruments of communication, recording, and imagining (dreaming) whose complexity and curiosity have been central to architectural theory and practice for millennia.

To heal is to make whole. Dis-ease (being out of ease) can manifest as physical or emotional pain, broken relationships, or spiritual unrest.</p> <p>The message of dis-ease is one of hope. The possibilities of the future exist now&#x2015;not as fantasies, but through the exercise of free choice in the present. Through choice, the future grows as the fruits of our present healing actions.</p> <p>In Part One of <em>Tarot for the Healing Heart</em>, you will learn how to create a healing atmosphere, including creating sacred space, centering, and dream work. In Part Two, explore the meaning of illness and learn to understand your own personal patterns of dis-ease and healing, including letting go of fear.</p> <p>Health attracts health, and Part Three examines healing as a lifestyle. This section includes healing meditations and visualizations designed to awaken your inner healer as well as methods of pain reduction.</p> <p>Part Four explores how to use the entire tarot deck for the express purpose of healing. In-depth descriptions of each card include the card's life lesson and life wisdom.</p> <p>You do not need to be a tarot expert or a healing practitioner to benefit from this book. All you need is a desire to heal, an open mind, and a courageous heart.</p></p><p><b>Winter 2019 / 2020:</b> <i>Tarot for the Healing Heart</i> was written in 2001.<b> </b>I wrote the best that I could at the time, but perspectives change a lot in 19 years. My biggest regret is that I hyphenated the word <i>disease</i> throughout the book to emphasize that disease means being <i>out of ease</i>. The constant hyphenation (dis-ease) really bothers me now, and judging from reader reviews on other sites, it bothered a lot of people! I would also like to redo the section on grief. We do not "move on" from the loss of a loved one! The following passage better describes grief healing:When <i>does</i> the grieving end? The honest answer is that it never completely ends. There will always be sadness and we will never forget, nor would we want to forget a life so dear to us; but the devastating emotions of new grief do subside over time. Grief healing is much like a burn--healing occurs with scars--and we are forever changed. &nbsp;I have read that we know we are healing when we think about our loved one's life more than the circumstances surrounding the death. Another turning point in grief healing is when the memories of our loved one bring more comfort than pain. A part of us dies when a loved one dies--the life we shared is gone. But if we allow ourselves to grieve, we will find one day that our loved one <i>lives on</i> in the life we create after loss.I wish I could go back and fix, add or delete a few things, but I cannot, so please accept my apologies in advance for the annoying hyphenation and other miscues.<br><i></i><b><i>Tarot for the Healing Heart </i>is out of print.</b> Used copies will still be available but I no longer have my own copies to give or sell.

His discoveries, including the temple at Abu Simbel, the pyramid of Khafre, and the tomb of Seti I, made a fundamental contribution to our knowledge of ancient Egypt, yet Belzoni has remained obscure-until now. His journal gives readers fresh insight into an exciting time in the history of archaeology and into the career of one of the pioneers of Egyptology, later praised by Howard Carter as &#34;one of the most remarkable men in the entire history of Archaeology.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Complete Price Guide to Watches 2012</h2><p>The most reliable and convenient guide to watches available, <i>Complete Price Guide to Watches</i> is the definitive guide for all levels of watch education and collection.

Marius Kociejowski presents a completely fresh and unexpected face to this mysterious country. Based on his own visits to Syria, The Street Philosopher and the Holy Fool describes a journey which brings him into contact with a host of colourful and unusual characters, each of whom is an outsider of sorts. <br> <p><br> Abed, the 'street philosopher', and Sulayman, the 'holy fool', are two of these intriguing people. Their friendship is emblematic of the polarities of Syrian daily existence - an ancient culture threatened by economic and political pressures. Sulayman is an alchemist and healer who moves along a path of asceticism strange even to his fellow Muslims.

WALLIS BUDGE (1857-1934) was curator of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities at the British Museum form 1894 to 1924. Among his many works of translation and studies of ancient Egyptian religion and ritual is his best-known project, The Egyptian Book of the Dead.A prolific Victorian Egyptologist explores, in this class book first published in 1899, the position of Ra, Osiris, Set, and Isis among the diverse pantheon of numerous deities of ancient Egypt, as well as their domination of the collective imagination of this sophisticated civilization. Hymns from The Book of the Dead illustrate the beliefs of the Egyptian peoples regarding the afterlife, judgment after death, resurrection, and immortality. <p> The writings of E.A. Wallis Budge are considered somewhat controversial today because of his use of an archaic system of translation, but useful illustrations and an abundance of information make them necessary resources for students of the ancient world as well as those of the evolution of historical study. Conveying the beauty and power of the religion of ancient Egypt, this fascinating book remains an important work today.</p></p><h2>Valley of the Shadow (Dakota Moons Series #1)</h2><p>Eighteen-year-old Genevieve LaCroix receives important life lessons when she travesl to the Renville Mission, which lies at the center of tensions between settlers and Sioux Indians. Original.</p><p>A native of southern Illinois, Stephanie Grace Whitson has lived in Nebraska, USA, since 1975. She began what she calls &#34;playing with imaginary friends&#34; (writing fiction) when, as a result of teaching her four homeschooled children Nebraska history, she was encouraged and challenged by the lives of pioneer women in the West. Since her first book, Walks the Fire, was published in 1995, Stephanie&#39;s fiction titles have appeared on the ECPA bestseller list numerous times and been finalists for the Christy Award, the Inspirational Reader&#39;s Choice Award, and ForeWord &#39;s Book of the Year. Her first non-fiction work, How to Help a Grieving Friend, was released in 2005. Her interests include pioneer women&#39;s history, antique quilts, and French, Italian, and Hawaiian language and culture.Evenhanded and lively portrayals of Christian missionaries and Dakota Indians distinguish this novel by the author of the popular Prairie Wind series. Genevieve LaCroix is a blue-eyed "half-breed," the daughter of a Sioux mother and a French father. At age 18, she is sent to live with a missionary couple, the Reverend Dane and his wife, Ellen. "Gen" befriends Ellen Dane (who is based on the real-life Minnesota settler Mary Ann Longley Riggs), but dislikes her husband, who, she believes, has only disdain for Indian customs. Death haunts the story: Ellen dies in childbirth (as does the baby, her third), and dozens of men are murdered when, in 1862, the Sioux rise up against their white neighbors. Gen risks her life to save the Danes' two surviving children. After the violence abates, the Rev. Dane confesses that he has fallen in love with Gen; his transformation from a removed, austere patriarch to a loving, emotive nurturer is surprisingly convincing. The religious themes are clear enough to please Christian readers, but subtle enough that they won't be off-putting to others. Fans of prairie fiction will be grateful that Whitson refrains from populating her pages with every important historical figure who set foot in the West during the 1860s, and that she spares us tedious attempts at folksy dialect. Instead, she serves up believable and sympathetic characters, conveying the atrocities that Americans of European descent committed against Native Americans without losing sight of the settlers' complicated, and often benevolent, motives. The ending, though not a stunning surprise, is far from the predictable conclusion featured in most historical romances. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cork Boat</h2><p>In the late 1990s John Pollack was working as a Washington speechwriter when, frustrated by the cynicism and hypocrisy on Capitol Hill, he quit his job to pursue a boyhood dream: to build a boat made entirely of wine corks and take it on an epic journey.<br><br><b>Cork Boat</b> tells the story of Pollack&#x2019;s improbable quest. Overcoming one obstacle after another, he convinces skeptical bartenders to save their corks, corrals a brilliant but disorganized partner, and eventually cajoles more than one hundred volunteers who help build the boat until their fingers bleed. Ultimately, Pollack completes his vessel of 165,321 corks and sets sail on a fantastic voyage down the Douro River in Portugal, where the Cork Boat becomes a national sensation.<br><br>In recounting these adventures, Pollack skillfully meanders through fascinating arcana, from the cork wars to the history of rubber bands (some 15,000 of which help hold his boat together). He also offers an insider&#x2019;s look at the White House, where he was a Presidential speechwriter and enlisted navy stewards to save corks for the boat.<br><br>Written with unusual grace and disarming humor, <b>Cork Boat </b>is a buoyant tale of whimsy, adventure, and the power of imagination.</p><p>&#x201c;A Quixotic tale that made me chuckle&#x2014;and brought a lump to my throat.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Witold Rybczynski, author of <b>Home</b><br><br>&#x201c;What can be more fun than a childhood fantasy realized and beautifully told?

For years it has lived in ignorance of the gleaming shore on which it lies. But its ignorance is not bliss. On a mountain peak, high above the city of Everville, a door stands open onto the shores of the dream-sea Quiddity. And there&#39;s not a soul below who&#39;ll not be changed by that fact! Phoboe Cobb, once a doctor&#39;s receptionist, is about to forget her old life and go looking for her lost lover Joe Flicker in the strange, sensual wonderland on the other side of that door. Tesla Bombeck, who knows what horrors lurk on the far side of Quiddity, must solve the mysteries of the city&#39;s past if she is to keep those horrors from crossing the threshold. Harry D&#39;Amour, who has traced the ultimate evil across America, will find it conjuring atrocities in the sunlit streets of Everville.</p><p>Clive Barker was born in Liverpool in 1952. He is the worldwide bestselling author of the Books of Blood, and of numerous novels including Imajica, The Great and Secret Show, Sacrament and Galilee. In addition to his work as a novelist and short story writer, he also illustrates, writes, directs and produces for the stage and screen.It may be the abridgment, but this attempt at horror is more fatiguing than frightening. Barker&#39;s story goes in various directions with little regard for logic or character motivation. Even experienced narrator John Glover can&#39;t do much with Barker&#39;s banal dialogue. D.A.W. (c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Bigger Than T-Rex</h2><p>In 1993, a giant bone was discovered by an amateur fossil hunter in the badlands of central Argentina. The two paleontologists who were summoned to the site thought it was the thigh of a plant-eating dinosaur, but further examination showed it to be the shin of a previously unknown species of predatory dinosaur. <i>Bigger Than T-Rex</i> is an account of the excavation of the fossil and the subsequent reconstruction of a dinosaur thought to have been bigger, heavier, and fiercer than the reigning "king" of the meat-eaters, <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>. In clear, easy-to-follow language, dinosaur expert Don Lessem explains how the scientists drew conclusions about the size and habits of the new species, how they came to give it its name-<i>Giganotosaurus</i>-and how it compared to other dinosaurs. Illustrated with color photographs of the excavation and meticulously painted reconstructions of <i>Giganotosaurus</i> and other species, here is up-to-the-minute news about dinosaur discoveries for dinophiles of all ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Grade 4-6. Step aside T. rex?there's a newly discovered meat-chomping dino about to take your place. Lessem presents "hot from the excavation" facts about Gigantosaurus, a newly discovered Argentinian dinosaur whose skull was six inches longer than that of any known Tyrannosaurus rex. The author provides a thorough recap of the fossil's discovery by Professors Salgado and Coria, and includes plenty of full-color photos from the actual dig. Brightly colored sketches make Gigantosaurus come to life, and illustrations with accompanying text allow readers to compare this new carnivore with others of its ilk. There's plenty of material for reports, and most of the information here is too new to be found in other popular sources. This intriguing update to dinosaur collections will be both popular and useful, and it provides a much-needed view of paleontologists' work beyond the confines of the United States.?Cathryn A.

Her account of female adolescent sexuality in Samoa initiated a career that led to Margaret Mead becoming &#x201d;indisputably the most publicly celebrated scientist in America.&#x201d; But what if her study wasn't all it appeared to be? What if, having neglected the problem she had been sent to investigate, she relied at the last moment on the tales of two traveling companions who jokingly misled her about the sexual behavior of Samoan girls? What if her famous study was based on a hoax?In <i>The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead,</i> Derek Freeman addresses these issues in a detailed historical analysis of Margaret Mead's Samoan researches and of her training in New York by Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. By examining hitherto unpublished correspondence between Mead, her mentor Franz Boas and others as well as the sworn testimony of Fa'apua'a Fa'am, one of Mead's traveling companions of 1926 Freeman provides compelling evidence that one of the most influential anthropological studies of the twentieth century was unwittingly based on the mischievous joking of the investigator's informants.But <i>The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead</i> goes beyond a historical account of how the hoax took place; it is an examination of how Mead's Boasian training set her up to be hoaxed and set others up to accept her conclusions. The book is more than a correction of scientific error: It is a crucial step toward rethinking the foundations of social science and the overly relativistic worldview of much of the modern world.</p><p>Margaret Mead's 1928 <i>Coming of Age in Samoa</i>, a report of her anthropological study of adolescent girls and a triumph of cultural relativism, firmly established her as a guiding voice of anthropology. Her work was mostly unquestioned during her lifetime, but in 1983 anthropologist Derek Freeman released a critical review of her work, showing that her assertion that adolescence in Samoa is easier because of free sexuality (upon which she based her nurture-over-nature theories) is in conflict with the facts of Samoan life and even with her own field notes. He suffered insult and approbation from nearly every member of the scientific establishment, to whom Mead was a hero and a saint, but he has rejoined the fray, perhaps to finish it, with <i>The Fateful Hoaxing of Margaret Mead</i>.<p> This scholarly review examines all of the primary sources related to Mead's fieldwork and the important 1987 recanting of one of her informers. Forcefully written and carefully constructed, Freeman's book shows that Mead's stay in Samoa was too brief and too consumed with a much larger ethnographic project to have accumulated much data on adolescent sexuality. Her need to finish the project and her fervent belief in culturalism then led her to accept the joking references of her two closest informers about free sex as truth. Careful to make it clear that his focus is on Mead's science, Freeman shows that it is extremely unlikely that Mead deliberately falsified her report, simply that her preconceptions blinded her to inconvenient facts.

An icon among Latin America&#x2019;s &#x201c;dirty war&#x201d; dictators, Pinochet had ruled with extreme violence while building a loyal social base. Hero to some and criminal to others, the general cast a long shadow over Chile&#x2019;s future. Steve J. Stern recounts the full history of Chile&#x2019;s democratic reckoning, from the negotiations in 1989 to chart a post-dictatorship transition; through Pinochet&#x2019;s arrest in London in 1998; the thirtieth anniversary, in 2003, of the coup that overthrew President Salvador Allende; and Pinochet&#x2019;s death in 2006. He shows how transnational events and networks shaped Chile&#x2019;s battles over memory, and how the Chilean case contributed to shifts in the world culture of human rights.<p></p><p>Stern&#x2019;s analysis integrates policymaking by elites, grassroots efforts by human rights victims and activists, and inside accounts of the truth commissions and courts where top-down and bottom-up initiatives met. Interpreting solemn presidential speeches, raucous street protests, interviews, journalism, humor, cinema, and other sources, he describes the slow, imperfect, but surprisingly forceful advance of efforts to revive democratic values through public memory struggles, despite the power still wielded by the military and a conservative social base including the investor class. Over time, resourceful civil-society activists and select state actors won hard-fought, if limited, gains. As a result, Chileans were able to face the unwelcome past more honestly, launch the world&#x2019;s first truth commission to examine torture, ensnare high-level perpetrators in the web of criminal justice, and build a public culture of human rights. Stern provides an important conceptualization of collective memory in the wake of national trauma in this magisterial work of history.</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;Reckoning with Pinochet&#34; is the best account of the trajectory of historical memory under Chile&#39;s restored democracy from 1989 until 2006, and a revealing window on that era and its democratic transition. It reflects Steve J. Stern&#39;s comprehensive knowledge of this period in Chile&#39;s history and his empathetic sensibility, which enables him to see the issues he discusses through the eyes even of people with whom he profoundly disagrees.&#34;--Peter Winn, editor of &#34;Victims of the Chilean Miracle: Workers and Neoliberalism in the Pinochet Era, 1973-2002&#34;<p>Steve J.

Edward Lippman describes the beginnings of mu-sical tradition in the myths and philosophies of antiquity. He shows how music theory began to take on new dimensions and intensity in the seventeenth century, how musical esthetics was specifically defined and elaborated in the eighteenth century, and how, by the nineteenth century, music became the standard by which other arts were judged. The twentieth century added problems, pressure, and theories as music continued to diversify and as cultures viewed each other with more respect.</p><p>Edward Lippman, professor emeritus of music at Columbia University, is the author of <i>A Humanistic Philosophy of Music</i> and many other works.</p><h2>A World More Bright: The Life of Mary Baker Eddy</h2><p>Rich in historical context and brimming with lively detail, A World More Bright offers an engaging portrait of this bold Christian pioneer and her undaunted search for truth.

An old schoolfriend&#39;s son has gone missing, the ghost of Jack Morton is inhabiting Rebus&#39; dreams, a part-time poisoner is terrorising the local zoo and a freed paedophile rouses the vigilantes.</p><p>When an author as successful as Rankin has been with his tough and idiomatic Scottish thrillers, a problem sets in after several books: how to keep the formula fresh.<p> Rankin has delivered a powerful series of books featuring his beleaguered Detective Inspector John Rebus, and while never less than gripping, a certain tiredness seemed to be setting in. Thankfully, <i>Dead Souls</i> is a resounding return to form, with a plot as enjoyably labyrinthine as any Rankin enthusiast could wish for, and pithy dialogue that fairly leaps off the page. Stalking the streets of Edinburgh on the trail of a poisoner, Rebus hits upon a freed pedophile and his subsequent outing of the man leaves him with very mixed feelings. But another problem develops for Rebus: a convicted murderer has him in his sights for some lethal games. And the tabloid press lionizing of Rebus won't help him in this situation.</p><p> As always, Rankin is perfectly ready to tackle contentious issues--precisely the thing that gives his books their powerful sense of veracity. And Rebus, no longer in danger of having a soap opera-like accumulation of personal problems, seems as fresh and well-observed a character as in those first exhilarating books. Rankin has caught his form again, with even more assurance. <i>--Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Who dares win: The story of the Special Air Service, 1950-1980</h2><p>Physical description; 249 p., [16] p. of plates : ill., maps, ports. ; 25 cm.

UFOlogists will not find the answers to all of their questions here, for although Vallee believes that UFOs exist, he has no idea just what they are. Therein lies the excellence of his dazzling diary: it offers a glimpse into the mind of a scientist who seems to challenge every preconception and established piety. To his academic training as a mathematician and scientist, which stressed rational approaches to problems, Vallee has brought an interest in the mystical, the psychical, and the paranormal. He has been a Rosicrucian and has studied the works of ancient scientists like Paracelsus. His diary is replete with profoundly insightful, often devastating observations about the strengths and weaknesses of France and the U.S., their academics and their researchers in industry.</p><p>Dr. Jacques Vallee is a leading researcher on the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects world-wide. Born in France, he studied astrophysics, and received his Ph.D. in computer science in 1967 from Northwestern University. The real-life model for the French scientist played by Francois Truffant in <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, Dr. Vallee's books have sold well over a million copies in many languages.Vallee's Anatomy of a Phenomenon ( LJ 6/1/65) was one of the first popular studies of UFOs written by a scientist. A computer specialist, Vallee became interested in UFOs after seeing an unidentified flying object near his home in France. His journals encompass a major portion of his professional life: his initial training in astronomy, his emigration to the United States, and his close association with J. Allen Hynek, noted adviser to the U.S. Air Force on UFOs. Vallee admits that he is no closer to an explanation now than he was 25 years ago as to what these objects represent. His research, however, points toward a paranormal answer, a theme he explored in Passport to Magonia ( LJ 9/15/69). Vallee characterizes the scientific community's lack of attention to UFO research as "one of the great intellectual failures of this century" and argues that U.S. government agencies have kept the best UFO data hidden and have shamelessly manipulated the public record. Vallee's journals comprise a fascinating intellectual odyssey that will be enjoyed by anyone interested in open inquiry tempered by rational thought. Recommended for most libraries.<br><i>- Gary D.

Where is God? Who is the one true God? Questions such as these have driven a thousand human struggles, through war, terrorism, and oppression. Humanity has responded by branching off into multiple religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam&#x2014;each one pitted against the other. But it doesn&#x2019;t have to be that way.<br><br>In <i>God Is Not a Christian, nor a Jew, Muslim, Hindu</i> . . . , the provocative and acclaimed Bishop Carlton Pearson follows up on his celebrated first book, <i>The Gospel of Inclusion</i>, to tackle these questions and many more, exploring new ideas about God and faith and putting forth the stunning assertion that God belongs to no particular religion but is an ever-loving presence available to all. For these beliefs, Bishop Pearson lost his thriving Pentecostal ministry but was catapulted instead into a greater pulpit. His readership has grown through appearances on national television and an extensive speaking schedule. With the world in the midst of a holy war, there is no better time for the wisdom of Bishop Pearson to reach a global audience.<br><br>Bishop Pearson&#x2019;s many loyal fans, along with new readers, will surely welcome this provocative and eye-opening exploration of a deeper faith, one that goes far beyond any fundamentalist way of thinking, be it Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, etc. Simply put, Bishop Pearson dares to tell the truth so many others are too afraid to face.</p><p><b> <br>Bishop Carlton Pearson </b>is an independent spiritual leader and author of <i>The Gospel of Inclusion. </i>He has been featured in numerous media venues, including <i>Dateline NBC</i>, <i>20/20</i>, and <i>This American Life. </i>He lives in Tulsa, Oklahoma.<b><b>CHAPTER ONE</b></b><br> <br>A CHURCH IN CRISIS<br> <br>In Christianity, neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point.<br> <br>&#x2014;Friedrich Nietzsche<br> <br>Just who and what is God?<br> <br>In many circles, that is not even a permissible question, and therein lies the crisis referred to in the title of this chapter. It seems to me that what I will call (with only the slightest irony) the &#x201c;spiritual-industrial complex&#x201d; has asked us to abdicate our minds in order to develop our souls. According to that way of thinking, intellect and spirit cannot coexist. They annihilate each other in the same way that water and metallic sodium, when combined, combust instantly and violently. Yet this same spiritual Mason-Dixon Line is also responsible for the bitter divide between science and the world of subjectivity, enlightenment, and consciousness. It is as if we are divided into two armed camps, each defending what it sees as the more important aspect of being human. And as Jesus said and Abraham Lincoln quoted, &#x201c;a house divided against itself cannot stand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Why are we on the spiritual side of this debate so opposed to questioning? Why do we demonize intellectual curiosity, scrutiny, scientific knowledge, and rational thinking? Is it because we fear exposure of our faith as unsupportable by fact in an age when fact occupies the pedestal where God once stood? That should not matter; faith is belief in the unseen, that which cannot be proved. Yet rather than deal with a changing world and the terrible consequences of the rift between faith and reason, many religious communities sequester themselves in an alternate reality where there are no questions, and all media, art, and culture reflect these simple ideas: Fundamentalists teach that God is good, God is everywhere, Jesus died for us, to avoid hell you must accept Him as your personal Lord and Savior, and so on. Many embrace conservative political views because such views stand for turning back the clock; a refusal to embrace unsettling changes in our social fabric, our sexual mores, and our environment. What some call faith is little less than a religion of denial and delusion.<br> <br>In his Gospel, John is said to have written: &#x201c;Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.&#x201d; I define light as &#x201c;higher consciousness.&#x201d; Light has not only come, light has always been, but people refuse to acknowledge it, because their deeds or functioning ideologies are not only evil but also awkward and disingenuous.<br> <br>This withdrawal from the world or reality achieves nothing except to make such faith communities at best irrelevant and at worst corrosive to the idea of bringing the worlds of faith and intellect together for the common good. How did we get here? How did a religion inspired by a man whose very purpose was to question the nature of the political and religious milieu into which He was born turn into something like a parent who doesn&#x2019;t want to tell his child whether or not there is a Santa Claus? I think such things begin as all movements do: with one question left unanswered and its asker discouraged from asking again. Suppression of inquiry is like a disease. So as I examine the reasons why God is not a Christian, I&#x2019;m going to ask some heretical questions.<br> <br><b>AGAIN, WHO AND WHAT IS GOD?</b><br> <br>God is like a mirror. The mirror never changes, but everybody who looks at it sees something different.<br> <br>&#x2014;Rabbi Harold Kushner<br> <br>The God question is a complex one. The question of and the quest for God have existed as long as humankind has had the ability to look at the stars or the lightning and ask, &#x201c;What does that light mean, and where does it come from?&#x201d; The concepts of God, divinity, cosmic consciousness as the great mystery make more sense than the increasingly monstrous entity that our imaginations have concocted over the millennia. In fact, the God billions worship is a human creation that, we are taught, gave Its life in order to answer our endless quest for life&#x2019;s meaning. We have created this child&#x2019;s God, the white-bearded father living in the sky, in our own image rather than the other way around.<br> <br>The God to whom I was introduced as a child was basically a Jewish one: male, fatherly, Anglo-European, bearded, angrily loving, judgmental, righteously indignant, and frighteningly powerful, not to mention present everywhere and all-knowing. In trying to make sense of this God, man has continued to manufacture and manipulate images of this perceived deity. The images have changed over the centuries, based on the mood of the times. During kind times when harvests were abundant and peace reigned (admittedly rare in the ancient world), God was benevolent. When plague and famine killed millions, God was portrayed as enraged and vengeful.<br> <br>To this day, this emotionally infantile God remains in power, a fear-based aberration produced by fevered imaginations, promoted by those who understand how such a deity can be used to gain and consolidate power over believers, and protected by flocks of billions who refuse to question their damning God for fear of their own damnation&#x2014;or out of an even greater immediate terror of social and cultural isolation. But I argue that it is precisely this image of God&#x2014;an infantile, simplistic, ridiculous notion of the sublime power that underlies the world&#x2014;that is destroying civil religion, fueling the rage of the &#x201c;angry atheist&#x201d; movement, and pitting science against the spiritual at a time when we should be using every tool within reach to discover what it means to be human&#x2014;and divinely human at that.<br> <br><b>TO SAVE GOD</b><br> <br>Interestingly, the Greek word for God, <i>theo,</i> is where we get our English words <i>the, thee, this, thou,</i> and so forth. It is also the source of the word <i>theory.</i> A theory is a speculative idea suggested to explain an observation. Theories must be proven before they can be considered scientific. However, it&#x2019;s always been my opinion that since we can&#x2019;t prove scientifically that God exists, then neither can we prove scientifically that He or it doesn&#x2019;t. That means the question of God doesn&#x2019;t meet philosopher Karl Popper&#x2019;s famous requirement that scientific inquiry means an idea can be proven false, so the issue of faith is beyond science. It is a matter of subjective experience and personal revelation, perhaps more than observation. However, science itself is a kind of God and may indeed be proof of divinity, depending how one defines or divines it. It seems to at the very least suggest supreme intelligence or order.<br> <br>Lately, I&#x2019;m not sure that proving or disproving God is even important. What seems important to me is that most people&#x2014; billions of them&#x2014;believe in a God and that superficial differences in the nature and pronouncements of that God (the content of the &#x201c;owner&#x2019;s manual,&#x201d; as it were) are the spark and gasoline for much of the global conflict that has consumed the planet for thousands of years, before the Crusades and the Hundred Years War to the modern jihadi movement. In his book <i>Conversations with God,</i> Neale Donald Walsch says that all behaviors are based on belief systems and that we can never hope to change behaviors until we understand the beliefs that underlie them. That is my goal with this book.<br> <br>What you believe or are convinced of, you are convicted by. Both the words <i>convince</i> and <i>convict</i> are derivatives of the Latin word <i>convincere. Vincere</i> means &#x201c;to conquer&#x201d; in Latin. In other words, whatever you believe has victory over you. You are conquered by what you are convinced is true. We are all victims of and convicted by what we believe and, in often awkward ways, of what others believe. I say this because our lives are shaped in great part by the core religious beliefs of others; they have much to say about our politics, our morals, our societal institutions, and, of course, whether and why we go to war. Those who say that faith and religion are irrelevant to modern life are mistaken; like it or not, they are extremely relevant, and it is worth spending some time and thought examining the reasons why narrow differences in how religious creeds interpret the reality or edicts of their deities fuel differences that in turn power the wheels of war, terrorism, oppression, and hatred. If we allow them to, they could also spark love, compassion, tolerance, and global brotherhood. Most religions have, somewhere in them, a capacity to inspire human grace and greatness in ways they rarely fully allow.<br> <br>I take issue with the position of the neoatheist crowd that says faith is an obsolete remnant of mankind&#x2019;s past that needs to be jettisoned as we would lop off a vestigial tail. However, I agree that the largely unquestioned concepts that underlie most of the world&#x2019;s faith traditions must be questioned and the fundamental assumptions of our spiritual lives revised if we are to survive this new session of turmoil and global change. Faith must evolve. God must evolve. Man must be the means of its re interpretation. As God saved us, it&#x2019;s now up to us&#x2014;as if it were possible&#x2014;to save God. If you ask, save God from what and for what, my answer is, from superstitious mischaracterization and superficial misrepresentations. God is too important to too many for us to make It out to be something so vengeful, derogatory, and paranoid as many perceive Him to be. We&#x2019;ll deal with this more throughout the book.<br> <br><b>WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY</b><br> <br>Albert Einstein once remarked, &#x201c;No problem can be solved by the same consciousness that created it.&#x201d; I think he meant that it takes different people to solve a problem created by others, but I believe that once we transform our own consciousnesses, we can indeed gain the perspective so vital to healing the wounds in the body of Christianity and perhaps its sibling faiths, Islam and Judaism, as well as others when and where needed. What is needed is a mutual &#x201c;stepping back&#x201d; and a brutal reexamination of the so-called truths of Christianity from the perspective not of a traditional believer but someone encountering faith for the first time. From that clarifying, terrifying, dizzying perch, Christianity, the religion of my birth that I have loved all my life, has some deep, staggering dysfunctions&#x2014;and in the eyes of millions of Christians themselves, has itself become the problem.<br> <br>When I say God is not a Christian, I am also implying that Christianity in its present form and function is less godly or virtuous. It has, over the centuries, become increasingly gaudy and ghastly. Racism, bigotry, sexism, elitism, arrogance, and ignorance have become its hallmarks, whether you&#x2019;re looking at the horrific child abuse scandals of the Roman Catholic Church or the attack politics of the religious right and its obnoxious hypocrisy. As I have moved freely among non-Christians as well as many of the opposing factions within Christianity, I have been confronted with the reality of the statement &#x201c;We have met the enemy and he is us.&#x201d;<br> <br>This is not a new problem. It goes back centuries, yet at the same time has shaped our modern age. The originators of Communism (Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Moses Hess) were Jews and were no doubt influenced at least somewhat by their religious and cultural mores. Adolf Hitler was recorded as saying to one of his generals, &#x201c;I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so,&#x201d; and &#x201c;My feeling as a Christian leads me to be a fighter for my Lord and Savior. It leads me to the man who, at one time lonely and with only a few followers, recognized the Jews for what they were and called on men to fight against them ... As a Christian, I owe something to my own people.&#x201d; Der F�hrer also used the famous temple scene of Jesus driving out the &#x201c;brood of vipers&#x201d; as a motivation for his evil&#x2014;never mind that his statement was a venomous twisting of Jesus&#x2019; words and intentions. Jesus&#x2019; opponents were the Romans and the Pharisees, not the devout Jewish laity of the time.<br> <br>In her book <i>The Christ Conspiracy: The Greatest Story Ever Sold,</i> Acharya S writes, &#x201c;Whether or not Hitler was a &#x2018;true&#x2019; Christian is debatable, as he also reputedly considered Christianity a Jewish invention and part of the conspiracy for world domination. Additionally, his paternal grandmother was allegedly Jewish. But Hitler himself was raised Catholic, and was very much impressed with the power of the church hierarchy. He pandered to it and used it and religion as a weapon. All during his regime, Hitler worked closely with the Catholic Church, quashing thousands of lawsuits against it and exchanging large sums of money with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>No, it&#x2019;s not fair to condemn Christianity on the basis of brutal and inhuman acts committed by a man who, had he not had religion to excuse his crimes, would have found some other jus tification. However, it is a hallmark of the &#x201c;faith motivated&#x201d; that many religious zealots use the &#x201c;will of God&#x201d; or the &#x201c;inerrant&#x201d; proclamations of a sacred book to justify thoughts and acts that range from the embarrassing to the horrifying. Is this a fault inherent in faith or in the faithful? I submit that it is both. On one hand, human beings appear to have a need, at this point in our evolution, to exert power over others using whatever justification they can find that will sway others to their cause. As Hitler did, those who would bend the plowshare of religion into a sword would doubtless do the same with skin color, language differences, ethnic origins, or sexual orientation. The need for power and allies always finds a way. The use of religion always comes in handy in facilitating such viciousness.<br> <br>But going deeper, religious belief itself, in its current form, breeds separation. We see God as outside of ourselves, and by engaging in different threads of belief, we endorse differing &#x201c;brands&#x201d; of God. There&#x2019;s the God of Christianity, the Allah of Islam, the Yahweh of Judaism, the polytheistic Godhead of Hinduism, and many more. This naturally creates an us-versus-them mentality in what becomes armed religious camps&#x2014;made worse by what we have already spoken of, that the claims of religion cannot be disproven. If you insist that your God told you to blow yourself up in a Jerusalem marketplace, no one can plausibly gainsay you. How would I know, especially if I believe in the kind of God who does kill, maim, and murder those He doesn&#x2019;t like or approve of?<br> <br>Changing human nature is perhaps the only more daunting task than changing the nature of organized religion, and it&#x2019;s one I will not take on in these pages. However, as we realize that &#x201c;church in crisis&#x201d; equals &#x201c;world in crisis,&#x201d; we see that we must take action in another essential arena: transforming the global perception of God and faith so that the Divine cannot exist as a context for intolerance, violence, and hatred. Our mission, my friends, is to make it so apparent that God would never condone the evils done today in His name that when a pastor suggests that God wants the congregation to support legislation that denies basic rights to women, homosexuals, or so-called undocumented aliens, even a child would be able to stand up in church and confidently say, &#x201c;No, He doesn&#x2019;t want that at all!&#x201d;<br> <br>But it&#x2019;s hard to get there from here. To reach that point, we must radically transform our entire c...</p><h2>Reckless</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

There are few insights, but plenty of dramatic incidents, in her flatly written autobiography; and though she claims to be a triumphant survivor, her book conveys an overall sense of sadness.

Stone walls and green hedges hugged the curves of the limestone hill where his horse stood, breaking the brilliant apple-green growth of high summer into gentle, rolling squares of patchwork. A small cottage stood to the side of the road. He could hear the hushed whispers of the farm children, who had crept out to gawk at him as he passed.<br><br>Over the past few months, he'd become accustomed to being gawked at.<br><br>Behind him, his younger brother's steed stamped and came to a halt. From this high vantage point, they could see Parford Manor&#x2014;an impressive four-story, five-winged affair, its brilliant windows glittering in the sunlight. Undoubtedly, someone had set a servant to watch for his arrival. In a few moments, the staff would spill out onto the front steps, arranging themselves in careful lines, ready to greet the man who would be their master.<br><br>The man who'd stolen a dukedom.<br><br>A smile played over Ash's face. Once he inherited, nobody would gainsay him.<br><br>"You don't have to do this." The words came from behind him.<br><br>Nobody, that was, except his little brother.<br><br>Ash turned in the saddle. Mark was facing forwards, looking at the manor below with an abstracted expression. That detached focus made him look simultaneously old, as if he deserved an elder's beard to go with that inexplicable wisdom, and yet still unaccountably boyish.<br><br>"It's not right." Mark's voice was barely audible above the wind that whipped at Ash's collar.<br><br>Mark was seven years younger than Ash, which made him by most estimations firmly an adult. But despite all that Mark had experienced, he had somehow managed to retain an aura of almost painful purity. He was the opposite of Ash&#x2014;blond, where Ash's hair was dark; slim, where Ash's shoulders had broadened with years of labor. But most of all, Mark seemed profoundly, sacredly innocent, where Ash felt tired and profane. Perhaps that was why the last thing Ash wanted to do in his moment of victory was to hash through the ethics.<br><br>Ash shook his head. "You asked me to find you a quiet country home for these last weeks of summer, so you might work in peace." He spread his arms, palms up. "Well. Here you are."<br><br>Down in the valley, the first ranks of servants had begun to gather, jockeying for position on the wide steps leading up to the massive front doors.<br><br>Mark shrugged, as if this evidence of prosperity meant nothing to him. "A house back in Shepton Mallet would have done."<br><br>A tight knot formed in Ash's stomach. "You're not going back to Shepton Mallet. You're never going back there. Do you suppose I would simply kick you from a carriage at Market Cross and let you disappear for the summer?"<br><br>Mark finally broke his gaze from the tableau in front of them and met Ash's eyes. "Even by your extravagant standards, Ash, you must admit this is a bit much."<br><br>"You don't think I would make a good duke? Or you don't approve of the method I used to inveigle a summer's invitation to the ducal manor?"<br><br>Mark simply shook his head. "I don't need this. <em>We </em>don't need this."<br><br>And therein lay Ash's problem. He wanted to make up for every last bit of his brothers' childhood deprivation. He wanted to repay every skipped meal with twelve-course dinners, gift a thousand pairs of gloves in exchange for every shoeless winter. He'd risked his life building a fortune to ensure their happiness. Yet both his brothers declared themselves satisfied with a few prosaic simplicities.<br><br>Simplicities wouldn't make up for Ash's failure. So maybe he had overindulged when Mark finally asked him for a favor.<br><br>"Shepton Mallet would have been quiet," Mark said, almost wistfully.<br><br>"Shepton Mallet is halfway to dead." Ash clucked to his horse. As he did so, the wind stopped. What he'd intended as a faint sound of encouragement sounded overloud. The horse started down the road towards the manor.<br><br>Mark kicked his mare into a trot and followed.<br><br>"You've never thought it through," Ash tossed over his shoulder. "With Richard and Edmund Dalrymple no longer able to inherit, you're fourth in line for the dukedom. There are a great many advantages to that. Opportunities will arise."<br><br>"Is that how you're describing your actions, this past year? 'No longer able to inherit?'"<br><br>Ash ignored this sally. "You're young. You're handsome. I'm sure there are some lovely milkmaids in Somerset who would be delighted to make the acquaintance of a man who stands an arm's length from a dukedom."<br><br>Mark stopped his horse a few yards before the gate to the grounds. Ash felt a fillip of annoyance at the delay, but he halted, too.<br><br>"Say it," Mark said. "Say what you did to the Dal-rymples. You've spouted one euphemism after another ever since this started. If you can't even bring yourself to speak the words, you should never have done it."<br><br>"Christ. You're acting as if I killed them."<br><br>But Mark was looking at him, his blue eyes intense. In this mood, with the sun glancing off all that blond hair, Ash wouldn't have been surprised if his brother had pulled a flaming sword from his saddlebag and proclaimed him barred from Eden forever. "Say it," Mark repeated.<br><br>And besides, his little brother so rarely asked anything of him. Ash would have given Mark whatever he wanted, so long as he just...well, <em>wanted.</em><br><br>"Very well." He met his brother's eyes. "I brought the evidence of the Duke of Parford's first marriage before the ecclesiastical courts, and thus had his second marriage declared void for bigamy. The children resulting from that union were declared illegitimate and unable to inherit. Which left the duke's long-hated fifth cousin, twice removed, as the presumptive heir. That would be me." Ash started his horse again. "I didn't do anything to the Dalrymples. I just told the truth of what their own father had done all those years ago."<br><br>And he wasn't about to apologize for it, either.<br><br>Mark snorted and started his horse again. "And you didn't have to do that."<br><br>But he had. Ash didn't believe in foretellings or spiritual claptrap, but from time to time, he had...premonitions, perhaps, although that word smacked of the occult. A better phrase might have been that he possessed a sheer animal instinct. As if the reactive beast buried deep inside him could recognize truths that human intelligence, dulled by years of education, could not.<br><br>When he'd found out about Parford, he'd known with a blazing certainty: <em>If I become Parford, I can finally break my brothers free of the prison they've built for themselves.</em><br><br>With that burden weighing down one side of the scale, no moral considerations could balance the other to equipoise. The disinherited Dalrymples meant nothing. Besides, after what Richard and Edmund had done to his brothers? Really. He shed no tears for their loss.<br><br>The servants had finished gathering, and as Ash trotted up the drive, they held themselves at stiff attention. They were too well trained to gawk, too polite to let more than a little rigidity infect their manner. Likely, they were too accustomed to their wages to do more than grouse about the upstart heir the courts had forced upon them.<br><br>They'd like him soon enough. Everyone always did.<br><br>"Who knows?" he said quietly. "Maybe one of these serving girls will catch your eye. You can have any one you'd like."<br><br>Mark favored him with an amused look. "Satan," he said, shaking his head, "get thee behind me."<br><br>Ash's steed came to a stop and he dismounted slowly. The manor looked smaller than Ash remembered, the stone of its facade honey-gold, not bleak and imposing. It had shrunk from the unassailable fortress that had loomed in Ash's head all these years. Now it was just a house. A big house, yes, but not the dark, menacing edifice he'd brooded over in his memory.<br><br>The servants stood in painful, ordered rows. Ash glanced over them.<br><br>There were probably more than a hundred retainers arrayed before him, all dressed in gray. He felt as sober as they appeared. Had there been the slightest danger of Mark accepting his cavalier offer, Ash would never have made it. These people were his dependents now&#x2014;or they would be, once the current duke passed on. His <em>duty. </em>Their prosperity would hang on his whim, as his had once hung on Parford's. It was a weighty responsibility.<br><br><em>I'm going to do better than that old bastard.</em><br><br>A vow, that, and one he meant every bit as much as the last promise he'd sworn, looking up at this building.<br><br>He turned to greet the majordomo, who stepped forwards. As he did so, he saw her. She stood on the last row of steps, a few inches apart from the rest of the servants. She held her head high. The wind started up again, as if the entire universe had been holding its breath up until this moment. She was looking directly at him, and Ash felt a cavernous hollow open deep in his chest.<br><br>He'd never seen the woman before in his life. He couldn't have; he would have remembered the <em>feel </em>of her, the sheer rightness of it. She was pretty, even with that dark hair pulled into a severe knot and pinioned beneath a white lace cap. But it wasn't her looks that caught his attention. Ash had seen enough beautiful women in his time. Maybe it was her eyes, narrowed and steely, fixed on him as if he were the source of all that was wrong in the world. Maybe it was the set of her chin, so unyielding, so fiercely determined, when every face around hers mirrored uncertainty. Whatever it was, something about her resonated deep within him.<br><br>It reminded him of the cacophony of an orchestra as it tuned its instruments: dissonance, suddenly resolving into harmony. It was the rumble, not of thunder, but its low, rolling precursor, trembling on the horizon. It was all of that. It was none of that. It was sheer animal instinct, and it reached up and grabbed him by the throat. <em>Her. Her.</em><br><br>Ash had never ignored his instincts before&#x2014;not once. He swallowed hard as the majordomo approached.<br><br>"One thing," he whispered to his brother. "The woman in the last row&#x2014;on the far right? She's mine."<br><br>Before his brother could do more than frown at him, before Ash himself could swallow the lingering feeling of sparks coursing through his veins, the majordomo was upon them, bowing and introducing himself. Ash took a deep breath and focused on the man.<br><br>"Mr.&#x2014;I mean, my&#x2014;" The man paused, uncertain how to address Ash. With the duke still alive, Ash, a mere distant cousin, held no title. And yet he had come here as heir to the dukedom, on the strictest orders from Chancery. Ash could guess at the careful calculation in the majordomo's eyes: should he risk offending the man who might well be his next master? Or ought he adhere to the strict formalities required by etiquette?<br><br>Ash tossed his reins to the groom who crept forwards. "Plain Mr. Turner will do. There's no need to worry about how you address me. I scarcely know what to call myself."<br><br>The man nodded and the taut muscles in his face relaxed. "Mr. Turner, shall I arrange a tour, or would you and your brother care to take some refreshment first?"<br><br>Ash's eyes wandered to the woman in the back row. She met his gaze, her expression implacable, and a queer shiver ran down his spine. It was not lust itself he felt, but the premonition of desire, as if the wind that whipped around his cravat were whispering in his ears. <em>Her. Choose her.</em><br><br>"Good luck," Mark muttered. "I don't believe she likes you all that much."<br><br>That much Ash had gleaned from the set of her jaw.<br><br>"No refreshment," Ash said aloud. "No rest. I want to know everything, and the sooner, the better. I'll need to speak with Parford, as well. I'd best start as I mean to go on." He glanced at the woman one last time, and then met his brother's eyes. "After all, I do enjoy a challenge."<br><br>From her high perch on the cold stone steps, Anna Margaret Dalrymple could make out little in the features of the two gentlemen who approached on horseback. But what she could see did not bode well for her future.<br><br>Ash Turner was both taller and younger than she had expected. Margaret had imagined him arriving in a jewel-encrusted carriage, pulled by a team of eight horses&#x2014;something both ridiculously feminine and outrageously ostentatious, to match his reputation as a wealthy nabob. The man who had taken everything from her should have been some hunched creature, prematurely bald, capable of no expression except an insolent sneer.<br><br>But this man sat his horse with all the ease and grace of an accomplished rider, and she could not make out a single massive, unsightly gem anywhere on his person.<br><br>Drat.<br><br>As Mr. Turner cantered up, the servants&#x2014;it was difficult to think of them as <em>fellow </em>servants, when she was used to thinking of them as <em>hers</em>&#x2014;tensed, breath held. And no wonder. This man had supplanted her brother, the rightful heir, through ruthless legal machinations. If Richard failed in his bid to have the Duke of Parford's children legitimized by act of Parliament, Mr. Turner would be the new master. And when her father died, Margaret would find herself a homeless bastard.<br><br>He dismounted from his steed with ease and tossed the reins to the stable boy who dashed out to greet him. While he exchanged a few words with the majordomo, she could sense the unease about her, multiplying itself through the shuffling of feet and the uncertain rubbing of hands against sides. What sort of a man was he?<br><br>His gaze swept over them, harsh and severe. For one brief second, his eyes came to rest on Margaret. It was an illusion, of course&#x2014;a wealthy merchant, come to investigate his patrimony, would care nothing for a servant clad in a shapeless gray frock, her hair secured under a severe mobcap. But it seemed as if he were looking directly inside her, as if he could see every day of these past painful months. It was as if he could see the empty echo of the lady she had been. Her heart thumped once, heavily.<br><br>She'd counted on being invisible to him in this guise.<br><br>Then, as if she'd been but a brief snag in the fluid silk of his life, he looked away, finishing his survey of the massed knot of servants. Beside her, the upstairs maids held their breath. Margaret wished he would just get it over with and say something dastardly, so they could all hate him.<br><br></p><h2>Family Limitation</h2><p>Originally published in 1914 as a pamphlet, <b>Family Limitation</b> is a basic instructional manual of basic family planning techniques. <br><br> While working as a nurse in the New York slums, Margaret Sanger witnessed the plight of poor women suffering from frequent pregnancies and self-induced abortions. Believing that these women had the right to control their reproductive health, Sanger published this pamphlet that simply explained how to prevent pregnancy.

In search of treasure in the southeastern wilderness, they betrayed and massacred a village of American Indians, leaving behind survivors filled with hatred and consumed with the desire for revenge. Many years later, archaeologist Lindsay Chamberlain's summer vacation trip takes her along the same path those ancient enemies followed, and their stories reach through time to touch her life in a remarkable and unexpected way. </p><p>During her trip Lindsay, who specializes in the forensic analysis of bones, is asked to investigate the accidental death of three cavers.

This slight story finds Mr. Little preparing his boat for a quiet fishing trip. Helping Mr. Little investigate strange noises on his boat, readers lift a flap on each page, to find a sea lion painting the foredeck, an octopus washing the porthole, a parrot sorting fishing lines, etc. There is an initial novelty of discovering what's under the flap, and the bold illustrations are eye-grabbing, but there is very little to recommend the book. Leave the novelty books to Tomie dePaola ( Giorgio's Village Putnam, 1982) and the boat books to someone like Jan Adkins, whose Workboats (Scribners, 1985) is much sterner stuff. Hayden E.

Introducing scientific concepts in the context of history, students will follow the work of the scientists who lived during the period known as "The Scientific Revolution." Arranged chronologically, chapters focus both on concepts as well as thinkers, including Galileo &amp; Heliocentrism, Descartes, Otto von Guericke and the Electrical Charge, Robert Boyle, Francesco Redi, Sir Isaac Newton and his laws, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and others. A total of 90 lessons are included; divided into chronological sections, each section contains 12 regular lessons and 3 challenge lessons for a total of 15 lessons. Depending on how much science you wish to teach in your homeschool, there are enough lessons to cover every other day for the length of a school year, or, you can finish the book by only doing two lessons a week (and skipping the challenge lessons). Experiments use common household goods, though for some items that may not be on-hand, a full list (organized by section) is provided at the beginning of the book. 308 pages with glossary and index.

There, in Yellowknife, in the summer of 1975, he falls in love with a voice on air, though the real woman, Dido Paris, is both a surprise and even more than he imagined. <br><br>Dido and Harry are part of the cast of eccentric, utterly loveable characters, all transplants from elsewhere, who form an unlikely group at the station. Their loves and longings, their rivalries and entanglements, the stories of their pasts and what brought each of them to the North, form the centre. One summer, on a canoe trip four of them make into the Arctic wilderness (following in the steps of the legendary Englishman John Hornby, who, along with his small party, starved to death in the barrens in 1927), they find the balance of love shifting, much as the balance of power in the North is being changed by the proposed Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline, which threatens to displace Native people from their land.<br><br>Elizabeth Hay has been compared to Annie Proulx, Alice Hoffman, and Isabel Allende, yet she is uniquely herself. With unforgettable characters, vividly evoked settings, in this new novel, Hay brings to bear her skewering intelligence into the frailties of the human heart and her ability to tell a spellbinding story. Written in gorgeous prose, laced with dark humour, <b>Late Nights on Air</b> is Hay&#x2019;s most seductive and accomplished novel yet.<br><br><i>On the shortest night of the year, a golden evening without end, Dido climbed the wooden steps to Pilot&#x2019;s Monument on top of the great Rock that formed the heart of old Yellowknife. In the Netherlands the light was long and gradual too, but more meadowy, more watery, or else hazier, depending on where you were. . . . Here, it was subarctic desert, virtually unpopulated, and the light was uniformly clear.<br><br>On the road below, a small man in a black beret was bending over his tripod just as her father used to bend over his tape recorder. Her father&#x2019;s voice had become the wallpaper inside her skull, he&#x2019;d made a home for himself there as improvised and unexpected as these little houses on the side of the Rock &#x2014; houses with histories of instability, of changing from gambling den to barber shop to sheet metal shop to private home, and of being moved from one part of town to another since they had no foundations.</i><br>&#x2014;<i>From <b>Late Nights On Air</b></i></p><p>Elizabeth Hay&#x2019;s fiction includes <b>A Student of Weather</b>, a finalist for The Giller Prize and the Ottawa Book Award, <b>Garbo Laughs</b>, winner of the Ottawa Book Award and a finalist for the Governor General&#x2019;s Award, and <b>Small Change</b> (stories). In 2002, she received the Marian Engel Award. Hay worked for cbc Radio in Yellowknife, Winnipeg, and Toronto. She lives in Ottawa.Harry was in his little house on the edge of Back Bay when at half past twelve her voice came over the radio for the first time. A voice unusual in its sound and unusual in itself, since there were no other female announcers on air. He listened to the slow, clear, almost unnatural confidence, the low-�pitched sexiness, the elusive accent as she read the local news. More than curious, already in love, he walked into the station the next day at precisely the same time.<br><br>It was the beginning of June, the start of the long, golden summer of 1975 when northern light held that little radio station in the large palm of its hand. Eleanor Dew was behind the receptionist&#x2019;s desk and behind clever Eleanor was the studio. She looked up, surprised. Harry rarely darkened the station door except at night when he came in to do the late shift and got away with saying and playing whatever he liked. He paused beside her desk and with a broad wink asked about the new person on air.<br><br>&#x201c;Hired off the street,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;The parting shot of our erstwhile manager.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, well, well,&#x201d; said Harry.<br><br>Despite the red glow of the on-�air light, he then pushed through the studio door, only to be met by one of the great mysteries of life. We look so very different from the way we sound. It&#x2019;s a shock, similar to hearing your own voice for the first time, when you&#x2019;re forced to wonder how the rest of you comes across if you sound nothing like the way you think you sound. You feel dislodged from the old shoe of yourself.<br><br>Harry had pictured somebody short and compact with sun-�bleached hair, fine blue eyes, great legs, a woman in her thirties. But Dido Paris was tall, big-�boned, olive-�skinned, younger. Glasses. Thick, dark, springy hair held back off a wide face. Faintest shadow on her upper lip. An unreasonably beautiful woman. She �didn&#x2019;t look up, too intent on the newscast typed in capital letters on green paper, three-�part greens, the paper-�and-�carbon combination the newsmen typed on.<br><br>He turned to check who was in the control room. Eddy at the controls and one of the newsmen standing at Eddy&#x2019;s shoulder. An audience, in other words.<br><br>Harry took out his lighter, flicked it, and put the flame to the top corner of the green. And still she �didn&#x2019;t look up.<br><br>An upper lip as downy as he imagined her legs might be. And yes, when she stood up later and came around the table, her legs were visible below a loose blue skirt, and the mystery of her voice was solved. She was European. European in her straightforwardness, her appearance, her way of speaking, which was almost too calm, except when the page was alight. Then her voice caught fire. She stopped turning her long pencil end on end, pacing herself. Stopped speaking altogether. Her eyes went in two directions &#x2014; one leg on shore, the other in the canoe, but the canoe was pulling away from shore and shit &#x2014; she picked up her glass, poured water on the flames, and read with jolting speed, repressed panic, to the very last word at the bottom of the page.<br><br>The news clip came on, she switched off her microphone and looked up wildly at the man with the boyish gleam in his eye. But he �wasn&#x2019;t boyish, he was balding, bespectacled, square-�jawed. She noticed his cauliflower ear.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re Harry Boyd,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>And she, too, had imagined another face &#x2014; a big, bushy head to go with the relaxed, late-�night growl that she heard only as she fell asleep. The man who&#x2019;d once been a big name in radio, she&#x2019;d been told. He was shorter than she&#x2019;d expected and his hands trembled.<br><br>Half an hour later, perched on Dido&#x2019;s desk, bumming a cigarette, Harry asked her how she&#x2019;d come by her intriguing accent. She studied him, not quite willing to forgive his outrageous behaviour, until he asked if she was Greek. Then out bubbled her easy and seductive laugh.<br><br>No chance. She&#x2019;d grown up in the Netherlands near the German border, the daughter of a Latin teacher who&#x2019;d listened to the bbc and written questions to &#x201c;London Calling&#x201d; about expressions he �didn&#x2019;t understand. Her father had a reel-�to-�reel tape recorder and taped programs off the radio. She learned English at school, she told Harry, but her pronunciation was terrible and so she&#x2019;d asked her father to make some tapes for her, and then she practised her English listening to Margaret Leighton reading Noel Coward and to Noel Coward himself, acquiring in that way her peculiar European-�English accent, which she hated. &#x201c;I figured marriage to a Canadian would solve my problem, but it �hasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two minutes,&#x201d; said Harry, &#x201c;and you&#x2019;re already breaking my heart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It �didn&#x2019;t last,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Then we have something in common, you and I.&#x201d;<br><br>He slipped her glasses off her face and breathed on the lenses and polished them with his handkerchief, then slid them back over her nose, saying, &#x201c;And Dorothy Parker said men never make passes at girls with glasses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Parker?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dorothy. A writerly wit who famously claimed to be &#x2018;too fucking busy and vice versa.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>Dido was only semi-�amused. To Eleanor the next day she called Harry &#x201c;the loser,&#x201d; a put-�down softened by her accent; it came out &#x201c;lose-�air.&#x201d; She said he&#x2019;d taken a drag off her lit cigarette, then set it back on the ashtray. &#x201c;So cheap,&#x201d; she said with a shake of her head and a faint, unimpressed smile.<br><br>&#x201c;But not without charm,&#x201d; countered Eleanor. &#x201c;Charm, sex, insecurity: that&#x2019;s what Harry has to offer.&#x201d;<br><br>Dido was more interested now.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s too old for you, Dido.&#x201d;<br><br>But his age was the last thing Dido minded.</p><h2>The American Frugal Housewife</h2><p>Newspaperwoman, novelist, and ardent advocate of women's rights, Lydia Maria Child (1802&#x2013;1880) was recognized as one of the foremost female authors of her day. Married at 25 to a charming dreamer whose irresponsible behavior quickly depleted their meager earnings, she compiled this book (based, very likely, on personal experience) for women of less than moderate means. "Save!" "Share!" "Do not destroy!" were maxims she repeatedly stressed. <br>Along with these words to live by, she also offered simply written recipes for roasting a pig, preparing a calf's head and buffalo tongue, as well as fixing corned beef, hasty pudding, carrot pie, apple water, cranberry pudding, and scores of other tasty and filling dishes. Her advice for non-culinary matters included suggestions for removing grease spots; cleaning pearls and white kid gloves; relieving chilblains, dysentery, and the night sweats; educating one's daughters; and dozens of other domestic concerns. <br>First published in 1832, this fascinating book was a "must" for every bride of the mid-1800s. Enhanced with a new introduction by cookbook authority Jan Longone, it will delight today's homemakers, antiquarians, and nostalgia enthusiasts with its charming glimpse into the kitchens and homes of the past.<br></p><p>Lydia Child, a woman with diverse interests belonged to America. She was an abolitionist, woman rights activist, journalist and an opponent of expansionism. She also voiced anti-slavery opinions and wrote pamphlets on the rights of all down-trodden people.</p><h2>Carthage Ascendant : The Book of Ash 2</h2><p>In the sequel to A Secret History, the fate of Western Europe and Africa lies in the hands of a female warrior named Ash, who alone holds the key to stopping the undefeated legions of Carthage that rage across the lands of Europe, by destroying a mysterious and living stone idol possessing an awesome power. Original.</p><p>In <i>A Secret History</i>, the first of a four-volume series, Mary Gentle began the story of Ash, a mercenary captain, and her band of 800 veterans embroiled in a war in 15th-century Europe. As the war assumes epic proportions, Ash--who hears a tactically astute voice in her head--becomes a sought-after commodity. Gentle, a writer who delights in confounding reader expectations, used as a literary device the insertion of e-mail from a present-day scholar and his editor to set up a series of intriguing questions about the main narrative: Are the Carthaginians' stone golems fantastical, or explicable in terms of alternate history? Is the shocking dimming of the sun evidence of magic, or of technology impossible in that milieu? Is Ash touched by God, or the end result of a careful breeding program? In the second volume, the author grins impishly and replies, "Yes."<p> Gentle keeps the reader enthralled on two levels. In the main narrative, Ash's enforced sojourn in Carthage is described authoritatively and viscerally. We believe in Ash, in her shock and pain and denial when she finds herself a slave in enemy territory. We understand her occasional despair, cheer her final refusal to give up, and absolutely delight in her hard-won escape and her satisfaction at once again donning armor and taking up her sword. However, it is the secondary narrative that adds depth. Gentle gives us explanations with one hand and takes them away with the other, while simultaneously posing ever more fascinating questions. The intertwined narratives reflect and complement one another, adding layer upon layer--and the sheen of brilliance--to the series. <i>--Luc Duplessis</i></p><p></p><p>The author of <i>A Secret History</i>, Mary Gentle has written eight books that have won critical acclaim from science fiction and fantasy authors and critics alike. She's completed two Master degrees and is an expert sword-fighter. Her home resides in England</p></p><h2>Mary Shelley</h2><p>Traces the life of Mary Shelley, describes her relationship with her poet husband, and discusses her own literary achievements</p><p>Muriel Spark is an internationally respected biographer, critic and novelist whose works include THE BALLAD OF PECKHAM RYE, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE and A FAR CRY FROM KENSINGTON.In revising Child of Light (1951), her first biography of Mary Shelley, Spark has drawn on newly available material in Betty T. Bennett's ongoing edition of her Letters (( LJ 6/15/80, vol. 1) and in the forthcoming edition of her Journals (Oxford). While Spark's critical judgments have remained stable, she now explores the several serious attachments Mary Shelley formed after her husband's death and concludes that like the heroine of her novel Perkin Warbeck , Mary Shelley was "doomed to a divided existence" between reality and the illusions fostered by her life with Shelley. Frankenstein was the first and greatest of her novels to emerge out of this conflict that first conventionalized and ultimately stifled her fictional voice. Generally recommended. Barbara J.

Their house is old and comfortable, full of unruly animals, and surrounded by gardens. <i>The Penderwicks at Point Mouette</i> is her third novel.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>The Penderwick family was being torn apart. The tearing wouldn&#x2019;t last long&#x2014;only two weeks&#x2014;but still it was uncomfortable. Mr. Penderwick was the first to go, flying off to England with his new wife, Iantha, for scientific conferences and a bit of honeymoon. With them went Ben, Iantha&#x2019;s son, who was too small to be without his mother, honeymoon or not.<br><br> That had been two days earlier, and now the remaining Penderwicks&#x2014;four sisters named Rosalind, Skye, Jane, and Batty&#x2014;were about to tear apart even more. Early the next morning, three of them would leave for Maine with their Aunt Claire, while the fourth headed to New Jersey with her best friend. The sisters had never been apart for an entire two weeks, and though all of them were nervous about it, the one going off on her own was the most nervous. This was the oldest, thirteen-year-old Rosalind, and she was having a terrible time accepting that her sisters could survive without her.<br><br> Right now she was waiting in her bedroom for them to arrive. She didn&#x2019;t want to be in her bedroom&#x2014;she wanted to be with five-year-old Batty, getting her ready for bed just like she always did. But tonight Skye and Jane, the two middle sisters, were helping Batty with her bath and pajamas. Practice, Aunt Claire called it, or a dry run. She&#x2019;d thought it would calm Rosalind to see that indeed she wasn&#x2019;t absolutely needed when it came to Batty. And Rosalind would have been calm, except that the others were supposed to come to her room as soon as they were finished, and that should have been at least ten minutes ago. How could a simple bath take so long? They knew she wanted to have one last MOPS&#x2014;that is, Meeting of Penderwick Sisters&#x2014;before Batty had to go to sleep. One last MOPS before they were all separated for two weeks.<br><br> &#x201c;Two whole weeks,&#x201d; groaned Rosalind, then looked up hopefully, because she heard footsteps in the hall. They were here.<br><br> But it was only one of them&#x2014;twelve-year-old Skye, the second sister&#x2014;and she didn&#x2019;t have the look of someone who&#x2019;d just conducted a successful bath. Her blond hair was hanging in damp clumps and there were wet spots on her tee shirt.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not as bad as it looks,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Batty&#x2019;s fine. She didn&#x2019;t drown or anything.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Then what happened?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Hound got into the tub with her.&#x201d;<br><br> That explained why Skye was so wet. The Penderwicks&#x2019; dog was large and enthusiastic&#x2014;getting him out of a bathtub would make anyone wet. But it didn&#x2019;t explain why he&#x2019;d been in the bathroom the first place.<br><br> &#x201c;Hound always tries to get into the tub,&#x201d; said Rosalind. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s not allowed near Batty at bath time. Didn&#x2019;t you know that?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nope, and neither did Jane. But we know it now, and we&#x2019;ll clean up the bathroom later. I promise.&#x201d;<br><br> A dry run! The irony wasn&#x2019;t lost on Rosalind. She was determined not to scold, though, not this very last night. &#x201c;Where are the others?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Jane is helping Batty with her pajamas. They&#x2019;ll be here soon.&#x201d; Skye shook her head violently, tossing droplets of water across the room. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your Latin dictionary? I need to look up <i>revenge</i>.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;On my bookshelf, though I wish you wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Rosalind knew why Skye was thinking about revenge, and that she&#x2019;d been thinking of little else for the last twenty-four hours. Which was absolutely not the best way to prepare for the next two weeks. With Rosalind off in New Jersey, Skye would be the OAP&#x2014;Oldest Available Penderwick&#x2014;and she needed to concentrate on taking care of her two younger sisters, not on carrying out revenge. &#x201c;Daddy says the best revenge is to be better than your enemy.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing that, too. Almost anyone could,&#x201d; said Skye, leafing through the dictionary. &#x201c;Here it is. Revenge: <i>ultio</i> or <i>vindicta</i>. Then it says: to take revenge on is <i>se vindicare in</i>. <i>Se vindicare in</i> Jeffrey&#x2019;s loathsome mother. How do I say Jeffrey&#x2019;s loathsome mother in Latin?&#x201d;<br><br> Skye&#x2019;s desire for revenge was justified&#x2014;Rosalind knew that. Jeffrey was Jeffrey Tifton, a boy the Penderwicks had met the previous summer while renting a cottage at his mother&#x2019;s estate, called Arundel. By the time that vacation was over, Jeffrey was their excellent friend and honorary brother, and since then the sisters had seen him as often as they could, which was nowhere near often enough. He was always too far away&#x2014;either at Arundel, a few hours west of the Penderwicks&#x2019; home in Cameron, Massachusetts, or at his Boston boarding school, a few hours east of Cameron. It had been natural then for the younger three sisters to want Jeffrey in Maine with them, and with great hope, they&#x2019;d invited him.<br><br> After much dilly-dallying and back-and-forthing by his mother, permission had finally been given, spirits raised, ecstatic phone calls exchanged&#x2014;until suddenly, just that morning, a mere twenty-four hours before departure for Maine, the permission had been withdrawn. Jeffrey&#x2019;s mother had decided that he wasn&#x2019;t going with the Penderwicks. He wasn&#x2019;t going anywhere. He was stuck at Arundel for the whole summer.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Painting Friends: The Beaver Hall Woman Painters</h2><p><i>Painting Friends</i> tells the story of ten Montreal women who met at art school in the early 1900s and formed friendships that lasted all their lives.

Twenty-eight-year-old workaholic Noelle McDowell takes a rare vacation from her high-powered computer company in Dallas to come home to smalltown Rose, Ore., for the holidays and help plan her sister's wedding. Noelle hasn't been to Rose in 10 years-ever since her high school sweetheart jilted her. Theirs was a secret romance because their mothers, one-time best friends, had long been engaged in a bitter feud that began when Sarah McDowell borrowed Mary Sutton's antique tea service and never returned it. A silly popcorn-throwing incident at the movies brings Noelle and her ex, Thom-now a handsome executive at a prosperous startup-together again. They discover they're still in love. But will their warring families ruin their second chance for happiness? Their mothers, coincidentally assigned to the same volunteer job-filling Christmas baskets for the needy-begin their charity mission with a vicious toy-throwing fight at a local mall. Will an accident during an ice storm provide an occasion for their reconciliation? There aren't exactly any hairpin plot turns in this formulaic, feel-good, PG-rated contemporary romance.

In 1947, as president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, he defied racism on and off the field to bring Jackie Robinson into the major leagues, changing the sport and the nation forever. Rickey's is the classic American tale of a poor boy from Ohio whose deep-seated faith and dogged work ethic took him to the pinnacle of success, earning him a place in the Baseball Hall of Fame and in history.<br><br>Bestselling author and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Jimmy Breslin is a legend in his own right. In his inimitable anecdotal style, he provides a lively portrait of Rickey and his times, including such colorful characters as Dodgers' owner George V. McLaughlin ("dubbed George the Fifth" for his love of Scotch); diamond greats Leo Durocher, George Sisler, and Dizzy Dean; and Robinson himself, a man whose remarkable talent was equaled only by his resilience in the face of intolerance. Breslin brings to life the heady days when baseball emerged as the national pastime in this inspiring biography of a great American who remade a sport-and dreamed of remaking a country. See Branch Rickey&#x2019;s life brought to the screen in the hit movie &#x201c;42&#x201d; in theaters everywhere now.</p><p><b>Jimmy Breslin</b> was born in Jamaica, Queens. He is the author of multiple bestselling and critically acclaimed books, and was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary. He lives in New York City.*Starred Review* Branch Rickey grew up poor in Ohio but graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University. Later, he invented baseballs minor-league farm system and built winning teams in St. Louis, Brooklyn, and Pittsburgh. Yet one accomplishment dwarfs all others: he integrated baseball when he signed Jackie Robinson to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers, breaking baseball&#39;s color line in 1947. The mistreatment of a college teammate fueled his altruism, but Rickey also knew black players would expand baseballs fan base. Breslin, the acclaimed newspaper columnist and best-selling author, tells the Rickey-Robinson story in his own inimitable style, pointing out that before Rickey even selected Robinson, he aligned New Yorks business and legislative power brokers into a supportive alliance. Much has been written about Rickeys commitment to Robinson, but Breslin brings out the fact that the experiment might never have worked if Rickey hadnt been such a shrewd businessman, challenging baseballs racist ownership and gaining the backing of the games commissioner. And, yet, the heart of the story remains Robinsons strength of character and Rickeys understanding that it would take a very special person to endure the humiliation that would come with breaking the color line. This is a wonderful book, bringing new life to a much-told story; long a social activist, Breslin is filled with disdain for the small-minded and the haters, while exuding admiration for those who defy them.

A thorough and objective history of the Black Panther Party, a group that embodied so many people's hopes at the end of the 1960s, but fell apart under pressure from without and from within. After the opening chapter, covering the headline-grabbing demonstration at the California State Capitol, Haskins shows how the party originated in reaction to violent suppression of civil rights demonstrations by police. In a lively style, the author describes the founders writing their statement of principles and organizing their supporters, then the various shifts of program and clashes among individuals and groups. The FBI's program of disinformation and destruction is covered, as are the police raids and murders and the Panthers' own violent acts. Most enlightening is the account of the power struggles in Los Angeles between the local Panthers and a group called US, led by Ron Karenga. Also notable is the description of how female leaders almost saved the party but saw their social programs sabotaged by the men returning from exile abroad. This title will fit well into high school curriculum dealing with recent history. It will be of particular interest to students researching the social movements of the 1960s, and those whose parents were involved in them. Black-and-white photos are primarily portraits of Panther activists. A unique source of information on an important period of our history.?Jonathan Betz-Zall, Sno-Isle Regional Library System, Edmonds, WA<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.Comparing the brief career of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense to a ``burst of radiation, searing American race relations,'' Haskins (see review above) shows how that tough stance--which struck a chord in African-Americans radicalized by the violent white response to the Civil Rights Movement--later collapsed under the weight of drugs, ego, and internecine conflicts. While acknowledging that, in its bid for legitimacy, the party made solid gains in local elections and founded several short-lived but visionary social programs, the author is more detailed as he recounts its higher profile struggles with other civil rights organizations and the police. He quotes the original ten-point platform in full but otherwise gives readers only hints of the nature of Black Panther rhetoric, the obligations membership entailed, and the size and growth of the organization. The result is less a study of the Black Panthers' philosophy, methods, and enduring influence than a cautionary tale about the hazards and misuse of sudden power.

Sibylle was the second daughter and unhappy last child of Lacan's first marriage: the fruit of despair (&#x201c;some will say of desire, but I do not believe them&#x201d;). Lacan abandoned his old family for a new one: a new partner, Sylvia Bataille (the wife of Georges Bataille), and another daughter, born a few months after Sibylle. For years, this daughter, Judith, was the only publicly recognized child of Lacan&#x2015;even if, due to French law, she lacked his name. </p><p>In one sense, then, <i>A Father</i> presents the voice of one who, while bearing his name, had been erased. If Jacques Lacan had described the word as a &#x201c;presence made of absence,&#x201d; Sibylle Lacan here turns to the language of the memoir as a means of piecing together the presence of a man who had entered her life in absence, and in his passing, finished in it. In its interplay of absence, naming, and the despair engendered by both, <i>A Father</i> ultimately poses an essential question: what is a father? This first-person account offers both a riposte and a complement to the concept (and the name) of the father as Lacan had defined him in his work, and raises difficult issues about the influence biography can have on theory&#x2015;and vice versa&#x2015;and the sometimes yawning divide that can open up between theory and the lives we lead.</p></p><p>Sibylle Lacan (1940&#x2013;2013) was Jacques Lacan's second daughter from his first marriage. A translator of Spanish, English, and Russian, she followed <i>A Father</i> with a book devoted to her mother (<i>Points de suspension</i>).<p>This book is the most beautiful testimony ever written about Lacan. Being the daughter of despair never prevented Sibylle from loving life so much that she could only leave it through a voluntary act. The reader will discover a true literary talent in these pages, as well as a generous supply of intransigence: a unique and poignant work.</p>&#x2015;<b>�lisabeth Roudinesco</b>, Head of Research in History at Paris Diderot University (Paris 7)</p><h2>Stefan Grossman's Early Masters of American Blues Guitar: Lonnie Johnson, Book &amp; CD</h2><p>The Early Masters of American Blues series provides the unique opportunity to study the true roots of modern blues.

This book tells the story of one of the women photographed by Lee. Doris Caudill lived on a homestead with her husband and daughter, who was six years old when Lee made his famous photographs, many of which show Doris planting her garden, canning vegetables, and milking cows. Now, more than sixty years later, Joan Myers, herself a distinguished photographer, introduces us to the woman behind the pictures.</p><p>Raised in West Texas, Doris first came to Pie Town on summer trips as a teenager. Faro Caudill courted her in Pie Town and brought her as a young bride to live in a dugout on a homestead in nearby Divide. Money was as scarce as water in this desert community, and a trip to Albuquerque, 180 miles away, was unimaginable. The Caudills went there only once while they lived in Pie Town, to buy a radio at Montgomery Ward. The nearest doctor was 60 miles from Pie Town, so babies were born at home and mothers had to be vigilant against accidents and snakebites. Although the Caudills and their neighbors lived in poverty that is hard for twenty-first-century Americans to imagine, Doris's memories of those Great Depression days are the happiest of her life. She was a lively young woman in the 1930s, and her sense of fun and the pleasure that the people in the tiny community took in each other's company more than made up for the hardships they endured.</p><p>Joan Myers tells Doris's story and recounts the experiences of Russell and Jean Lee during their stay in Pie Town. Woven through Myers's narrative are her musings on the relationships among memory, photographs, and actual events. Included are a selection of Lee's iconic photographs, Doris's family snapshots, and photographs taken by Myers herself showing the visual residue of those bygone years.</p></p><p>Tells the compelling story of one of the women photographed by FSA photographer Russell Lee, with additional photographs by the author.Joan Myers's photographs have been published in <i>The Santa Fe Trail, in Santiago: Saint of Two Worlds</i>, and, most recently, <i>Whispered Silences</i>.

He first experienced Reiki after suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome for four years. In a very short time Reiki greatly improved his mental and physical condition and general quality of life. It was this experience that encouraged him to learn this wonderful healing technique so that he might share it with others. <br> <br>On his path to learning the Reiki technique, David received instructions from three well known Reiki Masters and spent most of his time researching and trying to understand the origins of Reiki from both a practical and spiritual view point. <br> <br>Through Reiki, David says he has become aware that there was a deeply spiritual aspect to all living beings. To better understand this aspect of himself in the light of Reiki, he studied Buddhism and eventually became Buddhist. It wasn't long before he realized that Buddhism and Reiki complement each other greatly. But, as David points out, you don't have to be a Buddhist to practice Reiki. <br> <br><p>Llewellyn's "For Beginners" series aims to return the power of healing techniques to the people. Vennells has already written two volumes in the series, Bach Flower Remedies for Beginners and Reiki for Beginners. He experienced these therapies first as a patient, working to heal his chronic fatigue syndrome; he then became a practitioner and teacher. The current book discusses reflex locations, techniques, treatment sessions, and advice for the practitioner. There are over 40 line drawings, accompanied by clear directions. Vennells offers a philosophy of illness and healing cultivated in a Buddhist perspective. The only real drawback is the lack of stories to illustrate the author's points; the chapter titled "Case Studies" contains more testimonials and letters of encouragement from practitioners than true case studies.

The characters who people the &#34;Wild West&#34; are interesting and vividly described. However, Murphey is not an inspired reader. He has a pleasant voice but fails to add drama or intensity with pacing or even changing volume. This work is not very suitable for audio as it is not action packed nor is there much dialogue. The abridgment is also short and not engrossing. Though billed as a &#34;classic Western,&#34; this presentation will only appeal to real Western aficionados. S.C.A.

Set against the tumultuous backdrop of the war in the Balkans, <i>The Accident</i> closely documents an affair between two young lovers.<br><br>On a rainy morning in Vienna, a taxi pulls onto the autobahn only to crash into the median barrier moments later, hurling its two passengers a man and a woman from the backseat as it spins through the air. The driver cannot explain why he lost control; he only says that the mysterious couple seemed to be about to kiss.<br><br>As the investigation into their deaths deepens, a lonely researcher will uncover a mutually destructive relationship that blurs the line between fact and fiction, fear and desire, and love and fixation over the course of twelve years. An alluring mixture of vivid hallucination and cold reality, <i>The Accident </i>is a fever dream of a novel that marks a bold and fascinating departure from Kadare&#x2019;s previous work.<br></p><p>Ismail Kadare was born in 1936 in Albania. His novels have been published in more than forty countries, and in 2005 he became the first winner of the Man Booker International Prize.The name of the Albanian novelist Ismail Kadare regularly comes up at Nobel Prize time, and he is still a good bet to win it one of these days. . . . [He] is seemingly incapable of writing a book that fails to be interesting. His new novel, <i>The Accident</i>, is provocative . . . not least because of the way it starts out as one kind of book and turns into something else entirely. This, you feel, is how Kadare sees the world: as a place always shifting and remaking itself. . . . [<i>The Accident</i>] takes you to the sort of place novels don&#x2019;t routinely visit these days.&#x201d; <i>The New York Times</i><br><br> Vivid . . . Kadare dives deep into the pulling currents of love and death, carrying us down with him into a world which ranges, on the one hand, from dirty limericks about Bill Clinton&#x2019;s sexual peccadilloes to profundities about the relation of stories and death. Anyone who has ever suffered through a love affair or wondered about other people caught up in such torments will find this brief novel essential reading.&#x201d; NPR<br><br> [<i>The Accident</i>] is spare and often powerful . . . Kadare is inevitably linked to Orwell and Kundera, but he is a far deeper ironist than the first, and a better storyteller than the second. He is a compellingly ironic storyteller because he so brilliantly summons details that explode with symbolic reality. . . . [Kadare] is deeply interested in misreading, yet his prose has a classical clarity, so that much of his power as a storyteller has to do with his ability to provide an extraordinarily lucid analysis of incomprehensibility.&#x201d; <i>The New Yorker </i><br><br> A rich and strange examination of change . . . Kadare has constructed a maze of maybes where opaque motivations lead to startling ramifications . . . turning from realist mystery into surrealist foray. . . . Echoing with literary references, enriched by political relevance, Besfort and Rovena's investigation manages to seem groundbreaking.&#x201d; <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br> Absorbing . . . In his layering of truth-quests, Kadare, [echoes] the experimental-fiction writers Alain Robbe-Grillet and Jorge Luis Borges. . . . A gripping account of a star-crossed romance.&#x201d; <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br> Kadare&#x2019;s excursions into an eccentric style meticulous procedural scenes bloom into the surreal, languid eroticism mingles with the banal, dreams are scrutinized as readily as actual events provide moments both curious and brilliant.&#x201d; <i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br> Meticulously rendered and subtly nuanced. . . [<i>The Accident</i>] demands the reader&#x2019;s attention as it delves deeper and deeper into tortured love. . . . At once an exploration of human nature and a keen observation of Albanian life in the aftermath of socialist rule. . . . . The text is spare, urgent . . . as compelling as the love affair it documents.&#x201d; <i>The Brooklyn Rail</i><br><br> Dark, dreamlike . . . A provocative exploration of the sinister underside of human relations . . . [and a] compulsive and unnerving excavation of love, power and the imperfect art of storytelling.&#x201d; <i>The Observer</i><br><br> [A] forceful tale . . . Haunting . . . Lean, calm, and footsure, Kadare&#x2019;s writing keeps you reading. . . . With a Milan Kundera-like quality . . . [<i>The Accident</i>] is a compelling performance.&#x201d; <i>Sunday Times</i> (UK)<br><br> An author who richly deserves the Nobel Prize.&#x201d; The Huffington Post (Most Anticipated Novels for 2010)<br><br> If only most thriller writers could write with Kadare&#x2019;s economy and pace. . . . Kadare, magician that he is, offers just enough information for his readers to make myriad interpretations. He is the most beguiling and teasing of writers who understands that what may not be apparent now may well be in a distant future. As he writes in the final pages of <i>The Accident</i>, From every great secret, hints occasionally leak out.&#x2019;&#x201d; <i>The Sunday Herald</i> (Scotland)<br><br> A thriller laden with reflections on the abuse of state power. . . . Deftly, Kadare recreates the shadowy atmosphere of rumor and recrimination in Albania during the dying days of communism in the late 1980s.&#x201d; <i>The Evening Standard</i><br><br> [Kadare] has created Kafkaesque fables, nightmarish historical allegories, and his own very distinct mystery.&#x201d; <i>The Guardian Review</i><br></p><h2>The world book encyclopedia</h2><p>Parents, teachers, and librarians consistently rank The World Book Encyclopedia the best general reference source because of its easy-to-use format that students find so appealing. <p>&nbsp;World Book editors present information in a clear, direct style that makes each article readable.

Fuzzy sonograms and doctor&#x2019;s explanations can provide basic information, but through Alexander Tsiaras&#x2019; remarkable achievements in medical imaging technology, parents can <i>see</i>, for the first time, the awe-inspiring process of a new life unfolding, in stunning, vivid detail.<br><br>The milestones of pregnancy which before could only be described can now be witnessed: the heart&#x2019;s first beats; the appearance of color in the eye; the emergence of toes and teeth; the brain and nervous system directing development; the first movement of tiny legs and arms; the first indications of gender; the wondrous symbiosis of mother and child; the symphony of the body&#x2019;s systems coming into being and working in concert. The book tracks the development of a baby from the moment of conception, through the explosively complex early stages of development and the amazing stages of growth as the baby is nurtured by the mother, ending with the joy of birth.<br><br>All this is made possible by revolutions in two sciences. As biologists have decoded the molecular basis of life, computer scientists have developed non-invasive, three-dimensional techniques for visualizing the body. Alexander Tsiaras has been a pioneer in merging these explorations and discoveries. He has created a virtual camera studio that enables him to view a human body or any part of it individually, scan it, enlarge it, rotate it, adjust its transparency so that we can view inside a living being, and light it from any angle. The result is an ability to illuminate the unseen elements that make us who we are, and the miraculous images in <i>From Conception to Birth</i>.</p><p>Praise for Alexander Tsiaras and Anatomical Travelogue:<br><br>"A step into medicine's future."<br>-<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>"These images capture life and in their association with illness show it at its most mysterious and most vulnerable...A magical anatomy tour."<br><i>-The New York Times</i><br><br>"If there is to be an Audubon of the human form, Tsiaras can make rightful claim to the title."<br>-John Hockenberry, MSNBC<br><br>"A fascinating look at the inner workings of the human body."<br><i>-Newsweek</i><br><br>"This enormous cache of digital information is being transformed in a provocative new method of visualizing--and thereby understanding."<br>-<i>ID</i> Magazine<br><br>"[Tsiaras] reworks data to dazzling effects."<br>-<i>Scientific American</i><b>Alexander Tsiaras</b>, President and CEO of Anatomical Travelogue, Inc., has over twenty years of experience in the worlds of medicine, research and art and has won world recognition as a photojournalist, artist and writer.

Where our foods are raised and what happens to them between farm and supermarket shelf have become mysteries. How did we become so disconnected from the sources of our breads, beef, cheeses, cereal, apples, and countless other foods that nourish us every day?<br> &nbsp;<br> Ann Vileisis&#x2019;s answer is a sensory-rich journey through the history of making dinner. <i>Kitchen Literacy </i>takes us from an eighteenth-century garden to today&#x2019;s sleek supermarket aisles, and eventually to farmer&#x2019;s markets that are now enjoying a resurgence. Vileisis chronicles profound changes in how American cooks have considered their foods over two centuries and delivers a powerful statement: what we don&#x2019;t know could hurt us.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the distance between farm and table grew, we went from knowing particular places and specific stories behind our foods&#x2019; origins to instead relying on advertisers&#x2019; claims. The woman who raised, plucked, and cooked her own chicken knew its entire life history while today most of us have no idea whether hormones were fed to our poultry. Industrialized eating is undeniably convenient, but it has also created health and environmental problems, including food-borne pathogens, toxic pesticides, and pollution from factory farms.<br> &nbsp;<br> Though the hidden costs of modern meals can be high, Vileisis shows that greater understanding can lead consumers to healthier and more sustainable choices. Revealing how knowledge of our food has been lost and how it might now be regained, <i>Kitchen Literacy </i>promises to make us think differently about what we eat.</p><p><p>Ann Vileisis is a writer and historian.

This important and eye-opening book uncovers the machinery behind the modern food industry..." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"It is no exaggeration to say that the single most vital connection any of us has to the natural world is the food we eat. And yet the paradox of modern life is that over the past century, most of us have become profoundly ignorant about where our food comes from and the myriad ways it affects us. In her wonderful new book <i>Kitchen Literacy</i>, Ann Vileisis explains how we came to forget so much about the food we eat...and how much we gain by remembering the journeys it makes to reach our tables."

His dismay was echoed down the decades by disturbed ruralists, and yet the train has become part of our psychic landscape: some of the best-loved English poems - Edward Thomas's 'Adlestrop', or Philip Larkin's 'Whitsun Weddings' - have celebrated carriages, platforms and waiting rooms, while locomotion has inspired some of the most characteristic poetry of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Stevenson, Hardy and MacNeice, Betjeman and Auden (whose 'Night Mail' was written to accompany a 1930s GPO documentary about the postal express from Euston to Glasgow). Co-edited by two of our most distinguished poets, <i>Train Songs</i> offers a round tour - from Wordsworth to Hugo Williams and beyond - starting from the poetry of departures and brief encounters, but taking in the American Blues, the troop trains of two world wars, and the addiction to speed which characterised the European revolutions. Trains have carried the freight of history from the Industrial Revolution onwards - the Armstice in 1918 was signed in a railway carriage, the death camps were organized around train timetables - and this new anthology shows how the train in all its forms has exercised a unique hold upon our collective unconscious.</p><p>Don Paterson was born in Dundee in 1963.

Objectively Speaking includes half a century of print and broadcast interviews drawn from the Ayn Rand Archives. The thirty-two interviews in this collection, edited by Marlene Podritske and Peter Schwartz, include print interviews from the 1930s and edited transcripts of radio and television interviews from the 1940s through 1981. Selections are included from a remarkable series of radio broadcasts over a four-year period (1962-1966) on Columbia University&#39;s station WKCR in New York City and syndicated throughout the United States and Canada. Ayn Rand&#39;s unusual and strikingly original insights on a vast range of topics are captured by prominent interviewers in the history of American television broadcasting, such as Johnny Carson, Edwin Newman, Mike Wallace, and Louis Rukeyser. The collection concludes with an interview of Dr. Leonard Peikoff on his radio program in 1999, recalling his 30-year personal and professional association with Ayn Rand and discussing her unique intellectual and literary achievements. Ayn Rand is the best-selling author of Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead, Anthem, and We the Living. Fifty years or more after publication, sales of these novels continue to increase.</p><p>Marlene Podritske is a freelance editor, writer, and designer. Peter Schwartz is author of The Foreign Policy of Self-Interest: A Moral Ideal for America and editor of Ayn Rand&#39;s Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution.Freelance writer Podritske and author Schwartz (The Foreign Policy of Self-Interest) have selected 32 lectures and interviews from the 60-year career of writer and conservative philosopher Ayn Rand (1905-1982), founder of objectivism, beginning with her first interview in 1923, on the Depression ("Americans... don't even know what a depression is"), when the Russian �migr� had just sold her first story to Universal Studios. Rand's 1943 novel Fountainhead catapulted her to success (amplified by the release of a film version) that was solidified in 1957 by her 1100-page magnum opus Atlas Shrugged. Both novels and later non-fiction were conceived as vehicles for "objectivism," a laissez-faire world-view based around the ethics of "rational self-interest" (a more familiar iteration might be "Greed is Good"); among her followers were Leonard Peikoff and a young Alan Greenspan. Though she knew hers was "an extreme and unpopular viewpoint," she was a tireless advocate for "full, unregulated, uncontrolled capitalism," and a harsh opponent of conservatives who "tie their political views to religion." With transcripts from speeches, television appearances, radio shows and more, this will no doubt please Rand's fans and provide a great resource for students. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

If you use the three simple tools described in the book, your relationships will undergo a spiritual transformation. Specifically, you will feel a deeper sense of your own spiritual center, while at the same time seeing the spiritual essence of your partner more clearly. What allows this transformation to take place? It&#x2019;s the power of <i>Presencing, </i>a new set of relationship-enhancing techniques that enable you to slip free of the shackles of the past into a new space of creative freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on work with more than 3,500 couples and 20,000 single and divorced people,<b> Gay </b>and <b>Kathlyn Hendricks </b>discovered that relationships flourish when each person develops a body-sense of spirit. This means that each person must get deeper than the level of spiritual concepts to feel a living sense of spirit inside. Using the three specific tools described in the book: <i>Presencing Wonder, Presencing Spirit, </i>and <i>Spirit-Centered Listening, </i>couples feel more love and harmony flowing into their lives, and single people find it much easier to attract genuine love to them.</p><p><b>Gay Hendricks, Ph.D.,</b> and <b>Kathlyn Hendricks, Ph.D., </b>have worked and lived together for more than 25 years.

A man fond of sailboats, good wine, and women other than his wife, Ben Blaine has left behind a string of secrets in addition to an emotionally distraught widow and his strangely aloof mistress, Carla Pacelli, a beautiful television actress who once had a drug problem. <br><br>As soon as Adam arrives, he discovers that Ben has disinherited his mother, uncle, and brother in favor of his lover, and begins to wonder if his father&#x2019;s death&#x2014;caused by an inexplicable fall from a cliff&#x2014;might be murder. Using his training as a CIA operative, Adam skillfully seeks to obscure the evidence suggesting that a family member may have killed his father, while at the same time fighting to undo the will, which favors the enigmatic Carla. As he walks this tightrope, Adam risks his freedom and perhaps his life, even as he unearths increasingly disturbing family secrets never meant to be discovered, and which cause him to question his understanding of his own life and everyone around him&#x2014;his beloved mother, uncle, and brother and, not least, Carla. <br><br>Filled with tight psychological intrigue that will keep readers guessing until the very last page, <i>Fall from Grace </i>confirms that &#x201c;Richard North Patterson is one of the best in the business&#x201d; (<i>Time</i>).</p><p>Richard North Patterson is the author of over twenty bestselling and critically acclaimed novels. Formerly a trial lawyer, he was the SEC liaison to the Watergate special prosecutor and has served on the boards of several Washington advocacy groups. He lives in Martha&#39;s Vineyard, San Francisco, and Cabo San Lucas with his wife, Dr. Nancy Clair.<b>One</b><br> <br>Sliding into the taxi, Adam Blaine told the cabbie where to drop him, and resumed his moody contemplation of his father.<br> <br>The driver, a woman in her fifties, stole a glance at him in the rearview mirror. Though it was his practice in such proximity to be pleasant, Adam remained quiet. The past consumed him: he had returned to Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard, the home he had once loved, for the first time in a decade. Benjamin Blaine had made this possible by dying.<br> <br>Leaving the airport, they took the road to Edgartown, passing woods and fields on both sides. At length, the driver said, &#x201c;Forgive me, but aren&#x2019;t you related to Benjamin Blaine, the novelist?&#x201d;<br> <br>For a moment, Adam wished that he could lie. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Adam. His son.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman nodded. &#x201c;I saw you play basketball in high school. Even then you looked just like him.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was inescapable, Adam knew: for the rest of his life, he would look in the mirror and see a man he loathed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry for your loss,&#x201d; the woman continued quietly. &#x201c;I drove him to the airport several times. Such a vigorous, handsome man, so full of life. To die like that is tragic.&#x201d;<br> <br>Was it tragic for his mother, Adam wondered, or would release from Ben Blaine&#x2019;s dark vortex be an unspoken mercy? &#x201c;It was certainly a shock,&#x201d; he responded. <i>But not as much of a shock,</i> he thought to himself, <i>as the last time I saw him</i>.<br> <br>Understanding none of this, the driver said sympathetically, &#x201c;I guess you came back for the funeral&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t remember seeing you in years. Where do you make your home now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everywhere and nowhere.&#x201d; Adam paused, then deployed his usual cover story. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m an agricultural consultant in the third world, helping farmers improve their growing practices. Right now I&#x2019;m in Afghanistan, on contract with the government.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes in the mirror were curious and perplexed. &#x201c;Doing what, exactly?&#x201d;<br> <br>Adam chose a tone that implied his own bemusement. &#x201c;The project&#x2019;s a little peculiar. I survey land, and try to encourage the locals to consider growing something other than poppies. In Afghanistan, the Taliban turns opium into guns.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her face darkened. &#x201c;That sounds dangerous.&#x201d;<br> <br>Adam kept his voice casual. &#x201c;Maybe, if it weren&#x2019;t so dumb. It&#x2019;s a dangerous place, it&#x2019;s true, but I&#x2019;m well below soldiers and spooks on the hierarchy of risk. Why would the Taliban kill a hapless American on a hopeless mission? I&#x2019;d be a waste of bullets.&#x201d;<br> <br>Quiet now, the driver steered them through the outskirts of town. When they reached the church, the doors were shut. &#x201c;I hope you haven&#x2019;t missed the service,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>Adam wondered if this mattered. In his heart, he had buried his father ten years ago. But his presence might help three people he deeply loved cope with their ambivalence. Though all had suffered at the hands of Benjamin Blaine, they lacked Adam&#x2019;s clarity of mind.<br> <br>&#x201c;I imagine I&#x2019;ll make the eulogy,&#x201d; he said, and handed the woman an extra twenty. &#x201c;Can you drop my suitcase at the Blaine house?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jack, or Ben?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ben. Do you remember where it is?&#x201d;<br> <br>The driver nodded. &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Adam thanked her and got out. For a moment he gazed at the Old Whaling Church, absorbing the strangeness of his return. The deep blue sky of a flawless summer day framed the church, an imposing Greek revival with stone pillars and an ornate clock tower, all painted a pristine white. Along with the redbrick courthouse beside it, the church was the focal point of Edgartown, a place Adam thought of as the quintessential New England theme park&#x2014;picket fences, manicured lawns, white wooden homes built in the 1800s. Though the church was now a performing arts center, it was the only place of worship on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard, past or present, which could accommodate the hundreds of people who wished to honor a famous man. Had he foreseen his death, Benjamin Blaine would have chosen it himself.<br> <br>A policeman guarded the door. On the steps reporters or curiosity seekers had clustered, perhaps eager for a glimpse of the statesmen, writers, actors, and athletes who counted themselves as Ben&#x2019;s friends. Standing taller, Adam strode toward them. He even moved like his father, he remembered people saying, with his father&#x2019;s grace and vigor. As he reached the steps, the curse of their resemblance struck again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Adam Blaine?&#x201d; A young woman blocked his path, her look of birdlike alertness accentuated by quick, jerky movements of her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Amanda Ferris of the <i>National Enquirer</i>.&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite his annoyance, Adam almost laughed in her face&#x2014;this must be a slow week for Brad and Angelina, or the supposed progeny of Venusians and sub-Saharan adolescents. Instead, Adam brushed past her, ignoring her shrill question, &#x201c;How do you feel about the circumstances of your father&#x2019;s death?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Adam Blaine,&#x201d; he told the burly policeman at the center door, and stepped inside.<br> <br>The interior was as Adam remembered it, bright and airy, its tall windows on three sides admitting shafts of light. As softly as he could, he walked down the center aisle toward the front, glimpsing the varied players in Benjamin Blaine&#x2019;s restless and protean life&#x2014;a human rights activist from the Sudan; a veteran war correspondent; a retired Spanish bullfighter; an ex-president; a TV anchor; a young black man whose college education was a gift from Ben; the islanders, a more modest group, many of whom had known Ben all his life. Some of the latter, noting him, registered surprise at his presence. Adam nodded at a few&#x2014;his old basketball coach, a teacher from third grade&#x2014;all the while wishing that he could disappear. In the decade of his absence, he had learned to dislike standing out.<br> <br>Reaching the first pew, he spotted his mother between his uncle, Jack, and brother, Teddy. He paused, glancing at the casket, then slid between Clarice Blaine and his brother. His mother remained almost perfect in appearance, Adam thought&#x2014;the refined features, sculpted nose, and composed expression of an East Coast patrician, her blond hair now brightened by artifice. As he gave her a brief kiss on the cheek, her blue eyes filled with gratitude, and she clasped his hand. Then Adam felt Teddy grasp his shoulder.<br> <br>Inclining his head toward his brother, Adam caught the complex smile on Teddy&#x2019;s sensitive face&#x2014;fondness for Adam, bemusement at their circumstances. &#x201c;Can you believe he&#x2019;s in there?&#x201d; Teddy whispered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m still afraid this is a prank.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silent, Adam stared at the burnished coffin, the white cloth cover filigreed with gold. However richly Benjamin Blaine deserved the hatred of both sons, the enormity of his death was difficult to absorb&#x2014;a man in his sixties, still ravenous for life, cut short in so strange a way. How many times, Adam wondered, had Teddy wished aloud to him for this moment? Yet its reality left Adam with the fruitless, painful wish that he and his father had been different, that he could feel the ache of love and loss instead of this wrenching bitterness, the painful question <i>Why</i>? for which no answer could suffice. He was back, Adam realized, and once more Benjamin Blaine had shattered his illusions. Adam had not resolved their past.<br> <br>Nor would this service from the Book of Common Prayer, the touchstone of Clarice Blaine&#x2019;s heritage, provide balm for her sons&#x2019; souls. &#x201c;The trouble with Protestant funerals,&#x201d; a colleague had remarked to Adam after the murder of a friend, &#x201c;is that they offer no catharsis.&#x201d; But for his mother the familiar ritual, that with which she had buried both her parents, might spread the gloss of decorum over the deeper truths of her marriage.<br> <br>Standing near the casket, a young Episcopal priest recited the Burial of the Dead:<br> <br><i>I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord;</i><br> <br><i>he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live;</i><br> <br><i>and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. . . .</i><br> <br>Adam believed none of it. In his recent experience, death was random, ugly, and very final, all too often the work of men whose God commanded these acts. That world, like this service, offered no transcendence. His only comfort was that the survivors loved one another, and now might find some peace.<br> <br>Adam glanced at his mother, then his brother, trying to read their faces. Clarice wore her public expression, a mask of dignity she used to conceal more complicated feelings. But Teddy&#x2019;s dark eyes, cast now at the polished wooden floor, seemed to hold some anguished memory. At whatever age, Adam knew, some part of us is always a child, feeling pleasure at a parent&#x2019;s love or the wounds of a parent&#x2019;s disdain. The man inside the coffin had wounded Teddy long ago, too deeply to forget. From beneath the drone of the service, a memory of their father surfaced unbidden, as much about Teddy as Adam.<br> <br>It was from that final summer, meant to be a bridge between Adam&#x2019;s first and second years at law school, after which life would become too serious to savor the days of sun and sea and wind so evocative of his youth. The summer that instead transformed Adam&#x2019;s life completely.<br> <br>At the helm of his sailboat, Ben grinned with sheer love of the Vineyard waters, looking younger than his fifty-five years, his thick silver-flecked black hair swept back by a stiff headwind. To Adam, he resembled a pirate: a nose like a prow, bright black eyes that could exude anger, joy, alertness, or desire. He had a fluid grace of movement, a physicality suited to rough seas; in profile there was a hatchetlike quality to his face, an aggression in his posture, as though he were forever thrusting forward, ready to take the next bite out of life. &#x201c;When Benjamin Blaine walks into a room,&#x201d; <i>Vanity Fair</i> had gushed, &#x201c;he seems to be in Technicolor, and everyone else in black and white.&#x201d; As a boy, Adam had wanted nothing more than to be like him.<br> <br>On this day, Adam enjoyed his father&#x2019;s enthusiasm for his classic wooden sailboat. &#x201c;Well into this century,&#x201d; Ben had explained when he taught the eight-year-old Adam to sail, &#x201c;the Herreshoff brothers designed eight consecutive defenders of the America&#x2019;s Cup. They built boats like this for the richest, most sophisticated families of their time&#x2014;the Vanderbilts, the Whitneys. I bought this one from your grandfather Barkley.&#x201d; His voice lowered, to impress on Adam the import of his next words. &#x201c;To own one is a privilege, but to race one&#x2014;as you someday will&#x2014;is a joy. I mean for you to learn the primal joy of winning.&#x201d;<br> <br>On this sail with Adam, fifteen years later, Ben was preparing for racing season yet again, his lust for competition unstanched. &#x201c;This is the best thing in the world,&#x201d; he exclaimed. &#x201c;Even better than hunting deer. Are you ever going to try that with me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Adam adjusted the mainsail, catching the wind as it shifted. &#x201c;I doubt it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ben shot him a look of displeasure. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too much like your mother, Adam. But in this family you&#x2019;re the only game in town.&#x201d;<br> <br>At once, Adam caught the reference. However demanding their father could sometimes be with Adam, for years Ben had treated Teddy less like a son than an uninvited guest who, to Ben&#x2019;s surprise and displeasure, kept showing up for dinner. But the role of favorite by default no longer gave Adam pleasure. &#x201c;So Teddy&#x2019;s not like us,&#x201d; he rejoined. &#x201c;So what? I can&#x2019;t paint, and neither can you. Only Teddy got that gene.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Among others,&#x201d; Ben said flatly.<br> <br>As Ben steered them starboard, gaining speed, Adam felt his own tension, years of too many retorts stifled. &#x201c;Welcome to the twenty-first century,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Has it ever occurred to you that Teddy being gay is no different from you and I being left-handed? No wonder he never comes home.&#x201d; He paused, then ventured more evenly, &#x201c;Someday people won&#x2019;t read you anymore. You&#x2019;ll be left with whoever is left to love you. It&#x2019;s not too late for Teddy to be one of them.&#x201d;<br> <br>Unaccustomed to being challenged, Ben stared at him. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s supposed to be genetic. So call me antediluvian, if you like. But genetics gave me a firstborn who feels like a foundling.&#x201d; His voice slowed, admitting a regretful note. &#x201c;You like the things I like. Teddy never did. He didn&#x2019;t want to fish or sail or hunt or enjoy a day like this, God&#x2019;s gift to man. When I wanted someone to toss around a baseball with, you were like a puppy, eager to play. Not Teddy. He just gave me one of his looks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you ever care about what Teddy liked?&#x201d; Adam paused, then came to the hard truth he too often felt. &#x201c;Do you love me for me, Dad, or because I&#x2019;m more like you than he is?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ben&#x2019;s face closed, his pleasure in the day vanishing. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re not the same person, for sure. But we&#x2019;re alike in ways that seem important. Think of me what you will, but I desire women. I&#x2019;ve seen almost everything the world contains&#x2014;wars, poverty, cruelty, heroism, grace, children starving to death, and women treated like cattle or sold into sexual slavery. There&#x2019;s almost nothing I can&#x2019;t imagine. But one thing I can&#x2019;t imagine is you looking at a man the way you look at Jenny. Teddy sees a man and imagines him naked, lying on his stomach. Assuming,&#x201d; Ben finished, &#x201c;that Teddy is even the protagonist of that particular act.&#x201d;<br> <br>In his anger, Adam resolved to say the rest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always loved Teddy,&#x201d; he replied coldly, &#x201c;and always will. But given how you feel about him, it&#x2019;s a good thing that he&#x2019;s in New York. And given how I feel about <i>that,</i> it might be good for you to remember that I&#x2019;m the son you&#x2019;ve got left.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ben gave him a level look, deflecting the challenge. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in New York for now,&#x201d; he said at length. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s where artists go to fail. Inside him, Teddy carries the seed of his own defeat. My guess is that he&#x2019;ll slink back here, like Jack did. The larger world was a little too large for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Listening, Adam marveled at the casual ease with which Ben had slipped in his disdain for his older brother. &#x201c;Just who is it that you <i>do</i> respect, Dad?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Many people,&#x201d; Ben answered. &#x201c;But in this family?&#x201d; He paused, regarding Adam intently. &#x201c;You, Adam. At least to a point.&#x201d;<br> <br>Staring at his father&#x2019;s coffin, Adam wished that he had never learned what that point was. In kinship, he placed his hand on Teddy&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><h2>No Language But a Cry</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Full and deep and immensely moving . . . a standout shocker.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i></b><br><br> The child called Laura was the worst case Dr. Richard D&#x2019;Ambrosio had ever encountered.

There are also brief sidebars on oddities and happenings outside the mainstream, including several by James's wife, Susan McCarthy, on changes in uniforms.

Napoleon Bonaparte and his wife, Josephine, came to power during one of the most turbulent periods in the history of France. The story of the Corsican soldier&#x2019;s incredible rise has been well documented. Now, in this spellbinding, luminous account, Kate Williams draws back the curtain on the woman who beguiled him: her humble origins, her exorbitant appetites, and the tragic turn of events that led to her undoing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Born Marie-Jos�phe-Rose de Tascher de La Pagerie on the Caribbean island of Martinique, the woman Napoleon would later call Josephine was the ultimate survivor. She endured a loveless marriage to a French aristocrat&#x2014;executed during the Reign of Terror&#x2014;then barely escaped the guillotine blade herself. Her near-death experience only fueled Josephine&#x2019;s ambition and heightened her&nbsp; determination to find a man who could finance and sustain her. Though no classic beauty, she quickly developed a reputation as one of the most desirable women on the continent.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1795, she met Napoleon. The attraction was mutual, immediate, and intense. Theirs was an often-tumultuous union, roiled by their pursuit of other lovers but intensely focused on power and success. Josephine was Napoleon&#x2019;s perfect consort and the object of national fascination. Together they conquered Europe. Their extravagance was unprecedented, even by the standards of Versailles. But she could not produce an heir. Sexual obsession brought them together, but cold biological truth tore them apart.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gripping in its immediacy, captivating in its detail, <i>Ambition and Desire</i> is a true tale of desire, heartbreak, and revolutionary turmoil, engagingly written by one of England&#x2019;s most praised young historians. Kate Williams&#x2019;s searing portrait of this alluring and complex woman will finally elevate Josephine Bonaparte to the historical prominence she deserves.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Ambition and Desire</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br>&#x201c;Not just a scholarly work, but a page-turner . . .

Kate Williams lives in London.chapter 1<br><br>La Pagerie<br><br>One day in the spring of 1763, a young woman climbed to the top of a hill on a plantation in the south of the island of Martinique. Six months pregnant with her first child, Rose-Claire de Tascher de La Pagerie was twenty-six, a scion of one of the greatest families on the island, and not easily intimidated. For the last seven years of her life, she had watched the British and French war for control of the island. French forces had filled the nearby port, Fort-de-France, and both sides had fought bitterly. The French settlers on Martinique huddled in their homes, terrified of losing their land to soldiers or slave rebellions. Rose-Claire&#x2019;s handsome husband, with whom she was deeply in love, was among those who had defended the island. Finally, in early 1763, the British and French signed a treaty&#x2014;Martinique would remain French. Clambering up the hill, accompanied by her slaves, Rose-Claire watched the British ships on the horizon sail away. She patted the swell of her stomach, convinced that she was carrying a boy.<br><br>Three months later, on June 23, 1763, Rose-Claire&#x2019;s first child was born. The child who would later be empress of France had only narrowly avoided being born British. &#x201c;Contrary to our hopes, it has pleased God to give us a daughter,&#x201d; wrote Rose-Claire on the occasion of the little girl&#x2019;s birth. &#x201c;My own joy has been no less great. Why should we not take a more favourable view of our own sex?&#x201d;1 But Marie-Jos�phe-Rose de Tascher de La Pagerie was a terrible disappointment to the rest of the family. Rose-Claire&#x2019;s husband, Joseph de Tascher de La Pagerie, desired a boy who one day might gain greatness for his line. Her family wished for a boy to take over the land. As a girl, Marie-Jos�phe was not valuable, intended at best for an early marriage to one of the local landowners and life as a busy matron to half a dozen children.<br><br>Martinique was tiny, barely forty miles across and fifteen miles wide. It was four thousand miles and several weeks&#x2019; sailing from France&#x2014;and both culturally and geographically remote from the motherland. The French fought for its lush lands but saw the place as a cash cow and the people who lived there as provincial and ill educated. Some families came out from France to make their fortune there, but rather ashamedly, for the capital, Fort Royal, now Fort-de-France, was no bastion of culture. &#x201c;Everyone hurries to get rich in order to escape a place where men live without distinction, without honor.&#x201d;2 The women were indolent, while the men struggled to resist the temptations of drinking island rum, gambling, and dueling. Children were raised to take over plantations, as masters or wives, and few left the Caribbean.<br><br>Josephine was the name that Napoleon would give her. Marie-Jos�phe was known to her family as Yeyette, or Rose when they were being very formal. She was born into a dynasty in decline. Her mother, born Rose-Claire des Vergers de Sannois, was a member of a wealthy plantation family and a descendant of both Pierre B�lain d&#x2019;Esnambuc, who had established the first French colony on the island in 1635, and Guillaume d&#x2019;Orange, who had defended the colonials from the Dutch navy&#x2019;s attempt on the island in 1674. Rose-Claire was a proud member of an elite family&#x2014;the Sannoises owned swathes of land on Martinique, and her father was a true grand blanc, one of the prosperous landowners who retained near-absolute control over the island.<br><br>Rose-Claire should have married a son of another wealthy family. But she was still unmarried at the shockingly advanced age of twenty-five, when most other girls had been wed for eight or so years and were already mothers. So when the rather poor Joseph-Gaspard de Tascher de La Pagerie asked for her hand, she was delighted at the prospect, and her parents had no choice but to agree. Joseph was a charmer with an eye for the ladies. His father, Gaspard-Joseph, had been a steward on the plantations, with a reputation for irresponsibility and hedonism. Thanks to his skill at making connections, Gaspard managed to secure his son a position at the French court, as a page at the Palace of Versailles. The young man returned after three years, elegant, polished, and in search of a rich wife.<br><br>Newly married, the ill-matched pair settled in their home, the place where Rose-Claire had lived for most of her life, a large and beautiful plantation near the little village of Trois-�lets in the southwest of Martinique. Habitation de La Pagerie, as it became known, was 1,230 acres of highly fertile land, bordered by lush hills. Cocoa, coffee, cassava, and cotton flourished on the slopes, while sheep and cows grazed on rich green pastures and field after field of sugarcane surrounded the house. A small river&#x2014;also named after the family&#x2014;snaked through the grounds. Like most plantations, La Pagerie was self-sufficient and had its own carpenters and ironmongers, as well as a flour mill, sawmill, and hut for treating injuries and illness. Over three hundred exhausted, often sick slaves tended the sugar, the cows, and the cocoa, all of them crammed into poky hovels near the main house. Yet almost as soon as Joseph turned his hand to management, the plantation&#x2019;s fortunes began to decline. &#x201c;He means well,&#x201d; his brother said of him, &#x201c;but he must be pushed.&#x201d;3<br><br>Yeyette, the future empress of France, had, as she herself claimed, a &#x201c;spoilt childhood.&#x201d;4 Her parents, grandparents, and unmarried aunt let her do as she pleased. Her home was a large plantation house, a single-story white wooden dwelling with large open windows, without glass. Like all plantation houses, it was in the center of the grounds, to allow the owner to oversee the labor of his slaves. There were more than four hundred plantations on the island, and La Pagerie was comparatively small and humble, though pretty to look at&#x2014;for the white inhabitants, at least. Nestled against three sides of the house was a sheltered veranda decked with blossoms. Around it were the outbuildings and a pretty garden, overhung with tamarind, mango, and frangipani trees and surrounded by a floral hedge. Today all that remains of the domestic buildings is the kitchen, for, as was customary, it was built of stone rather than wood. It is now part of the La Pagerie Museum in Martinique, and without all the paraphernalia of saucepans and pots, its sheer size indicates how much food even a small family and their attendants would require.<br><br>Yeyette grew into an engaging, happy child with limpid amber eyes and a fine complexion. Like all plantation children, she had a black wet nurse (a custom that shocked the French). The little girl spent her days with her nurse, Marion, and her maids, Genevi�ve and Mauricette, who devoted themselves to her care. Anxious to preserve their position as house servants, they obeyed Yeyette&#x2019;s every whim and treated her like a princess.<br><br>&#x201c;I ran, I jumped, I danced, from morning to night; no one restrained the wild movements of my childhood,&#x201d; Yeyette rhapsodized.5 Her sister, Catherine, arrived on December 11, 1764, and the two were companions, playing hide-and-seek among the bushes and making toys out of sticks. Few other inhabitants on the plantation were so free. Sugar was an exacting master&#x2014;as soon as one crop was harvested, it was ready to be planted again. The underfed slaves worked from six in the morning until seven at night throughout the year, digging, planting, reaping, and then beginning once more. They toiled under the broiling sun and were treated harshly, punished with the lash of the whip. As soon as the sugar was harvested, they had to extract the juice, a process that had them working up to eighteen hours a day. In the sugar mill, at the center of the property, female slaves pushed the cane through rollers to crush it. Cutlasses were kept on hand, for the slaves frequently caught their arms in the machinery and the quickest way to free them was to cut off the arm. Elsewhere, in the sucrerie or purgerie (the sugarhouse), the slaves struggled in the terrible heat of the boiler room to press the juice into thick sugar syrup.<br><br>Martinique was the third stop on the well-traveled French slave trade route. African men and women were captured and sold on the Ivory Coast in exchange for gold, tobacco, guns, gunpowder, or cloth, and were then crammed into ships bound for France. In France, the ships took on supplies required in the Caribbean and set off, full of slaves and books, gowns and furniture. When little Yeyette went to the port, she saw the slaves being taken off the ships and hauled to market, branded, shackled, and then sold. Emptied of their human cargo, the ships were loaded up with bundles and crates and sent back to France, where eager ladies awaited sugar for their tea and cocoa for their stores.<br><br>The children of slaves were the possession of their mother&#x2019;s owner. Slaves were not permitted belongings or even to pass down a family name. The punishments allowed in colonial French society were severe&#x2014;ranging from brutal beatings to brandings to being burned alive. Slaves could be covered in honey and placed on anthills to be stung to death, shot (although owners thought this a waste of bullets), drowned, or thrown into ovens. The average life expectancy of a slave was twenty-five.<br><br>As she skipped in the garden, Yeyette often heard the slaves cry out. When she and her family sat indoors, dining on fish, roast meats, pastries, and sweet fruit, the red flames of the slaves&#x2019; night fires shimmered at the windows, and their songs rang through the darkness. The air of the plantation was always slightly sweet, and during syrup-making time, it was thick with the smell of burned sugar. Typically, Yeyette played with the slave children who were her own age: She was especially fond of one-legged Boyoco and weak, often sick Timideas. Yeyette&#x2019;s daily life was bound up with the slaves, and she did not question it. Slaves, she thought, were the way of the world.<br><br>About forty slaves had the better luck to work directly for the family as maids, cooks, laundresses, and manservants. For the families, they were both friend and foe, the serpents in the bosom they feared might turn to poison or the knife in a moment of rage&#x2014;or, for the women, seduce their husbands. Female slaves were accepted as a sexual resource for the colonial men. Some of the slaves closest to Yeyette were probably also her relations. Her devoted mulatto nurse, Marion, could have been the daughter of her grandfather or perhaps the overseer, and her delicate maid, Euph�mie Lef�vre, who traveled with her to Paris and whom she supported for the rest of her life, was very likely the daughter of Joseph, her father. Euph�mie was her day-to-day companion, her maid, and her friend.<br><br>The slave owners lived in fear that their slaves would rise against them. They worried about the runaways, who hid out in the hills and plotted revenge, and they fretted about murder&#x2014;indeed, Yeyette&#x2019;s mother would later prosecute one of her house slaves for attempting to poison her. The news of the abolitionist movement, gaining credibility in France, infuriated the grands blancs, who became increasingly defensive of their way of life. Across the rest of the world, there was a growing sense that slavery was unfair and cruel. The British and French economies were reliant on the produce of the Caribbean islands, but Quakers and other religious groups had long been suggesting that the price was too high to pay. One later cartoon showed drops of sugar as slaves&#x2019; tears in ladies&#x2019; cups of tea. In 1771, John Somersett, a slave who had been brought to Britain by an American customs officer, escaped and was recaptured. After a highly publicized trial, it was declared illegal to hold and remove him against his will. In Britain (if not the wider British Empire), a man could not be a possession. The question of whether slavery should be abolished was swirling in settler society, even though many tried to ignore it.<br><br>Creoles, the name given to whites born in the Caribbean, had a reputation in France for being pleasure-loving, lazy, sensual, capricious&#x2014;and possessed of arcane sexual skills. As an adult, Josephine traded on her reputation as seductive&#x2014;but the other characteristics were true of her as well. She had scant discipline as a child. While she was running wild on the grounds of La Pagerie, her future friends in France were strictly educated in chilly houses, dressed in stiff frills for show, always told to sit up straight, and kept to a rigid timetable of lessons and a diet of plain food.<br><br>Rose-Claire had little time for educating Yeyette and Catherine. They lived in a paradise of pleasure, and their lives were unintellectual and free. Yeyette dashed about with Euph�mie and Marion, wearing the loose cotton dresses that were customary for colonial children, and discovering lizards and butterflies, picking flowers and the fruit that hung heavy on the trees. As she grew older, she rode around on her Spanish pony, took long walks to the hills and splashed in the sea like a dolphin. She sucked on sugarcane plucked from the fields, and drank the syrup so enthusiastically that she gave herself a cavity in her front incisor. In adulthood, her teeth gave her pain; to hide them, she smiled with her lips pressed closed, looking enigmatic and mysterious to those who did not know the truth.<br><br>She adored her home, but her father was less content. After living off his father for years, he had expected to be cosseted by his wife&#x2019;s family. To his horror, he found that Rose-Claire and her parents wished him to be the head of the family, stewarding La Pagerie through crises and devoting himself to their care. He was incompetent and unlucky at business, with no aptitude for the dreary tasks of supervising the overseer, checking the books, and keeping careful accounts of what was bought and sold, and he was uninterested in befriending fellow traders. His health was poor, he hated the heat, he suffered frequent bouts of malaria, and he resented his wife for not having a son. Marooned owing to bad roads, La Pagerie received few visitors outside of feast days, and Joseph became consumed by nostalgia for the balls and soir�es of Versailles. Soon he was hardly ever at home, throwing himself into gambling at cards and nights with mistresses in the capital. &#x201c;He spends his time in his charming Fort Royal where he finds more pleasure than he does with me and his children,&#x201d; Rose-Claire wrote to Edm�e, her husband&#x2019;s sister, in 1765.6 She was pregnant again and yearning for a boy. &#x201c;I hope with all my heart that it will be the little nephew you desire; perhaps that will give his father a little more love for me,&#x201d; she said.</p><h2>The Boys of &#39;98: Theodore Roosevelt and the Rough Riders</h2><p>Documents the recruitment, training, fighting, and post-Spanish American War careers of the soldiers who comprised the volunteer cavalry regiment known as the Rough Riders</p><p>"Walker captures the spirit of the times and demonstrates both skill and style in chronicling the events that led to war . . . .

On October 27, 1492, the Genoese captain-general Cristoforo Colombo sighted the shimmering emerald hills off the bow of the <i>Santa Mar�a.</i> He signaled his ships to follow and his little fleet tentatively scouted the coast of the new land, finding many pristine, natural harbors, inlets and coves ringed by wide beaches of white sand backed by a loud wall of palms, flowers and foliage gorgeous beyond description.On the 29th the <i>Santa Mar�a,</i> the <i>Ni�a</i> and <i>Pinta</i> found an anchorage at a place he called Puerto Gibara and the crew landed to fill water casks. Columbus and his men spent twelve days at Gibara before moving on to explore the coast to the east. He wrote exultantly of what he saw: "Everything is green as April in Andalusia. The singing of the birds is such that it seems as if one would never desire to depart. There are flocks of parrots that obscurethe sun. There are trees of a thousand species, each having its particular fruit, and all of marvelous flavor."But amidst this lush splendor, the captain-general had reason to be discouraged. He had fully expected to be greeted at some point along the coast by a fleet of junks carrying delegates from the Great Khan. The native Taino Indians called their big island "Colba," but Columbus was certain he had reached Mangi, the name Marco Polo gave to South China.He was 13,000 miles from the fabled Indies.As he sailed east toward the Windward Passage and Hispaniola, he watched from the stern of the <i>Santa Mar�a</i> as the land he had named Isla de Juana (after the Prince of Castile) disappeared in the mist. "It is the most beautiful land that ever eyes beheld," he wrote.2<i>"Oh, the pity of it ..."</i>The Spanish Empire in the New World broke up after 1808 but Cuba remained loyal to the Crown, survived many revolutions and came to be known as one (Puerto Rico the other) of "the Ever-faithful Isles" and "the Pearl of the Antilles." The resplendence of the island, its limitless resources, strategic location and great shipping port at Havana were for a century the subject of intermittant debate ninety miles north across the Florida Straits.During the negotiations for what would become the Louisiana Purchase, Thomas Jefferson had advanced the idea that Spain might "with difficulty" relinquish Cuba. If attained by the United States, he suggested a column be erected on the southernmost edge of the island inscribed with the words "Ne Plus Ultra" to signify the utmost point of American expansion in the West Indies.John Quincy Adams wrote of Cuba and Puerto Rico as "natural appendages of the North American continent."In the mid-1840s, in the time of that fierce flexing of expansionist muscle which a New York editor called the nation's "manifest destiny," Americans were on the march to the Halls of Montezuma and the shores of Mexico's province of California. As if that were not enough, President James K. Polk, eyes darting around a map of the hemisphere, tendered an offer to Spain to buy Cuba for $100 million. The offer was declined, but Polk's successor, Franklin Pierce, renewed it in 1854, calling for a conference of ministers to be held in Ostend, Belgium, toward the view of "acquiring" Cuba. Pierce's successor, James Buchanan, was one of the signers of the Ostend Manifesto.During the Polk administration, during the apex of the dizzying era of Manifest Destiny, New York City became the locus of the Cuban freedom movement in the United States. This was heralded by the arrival in the city, in the summer of 1848, of General Narcisco L�pez, a once loyal officer of the army of Spain who became a passionate rebel after being sent to Cuba as a reward for a lifetime of service to the Crown. L�pez could not have timed his advent more impeccably. He found Americans energized by the successes in the Mexican War and still hungry for conquest as he began recruiting followers and making his plans to invade the Pearl of the Antilles.After a failed foray to the island with a small band of ne'er-do-well American followers in May 1850, L�pez moved his operation to the south where his ideas of bringing Cuba into the Union as a slave state found more enthusiasm. In August 1851, after gathering a force of 300--many of them Americans--he sailed from New Orleans in the steamer <i>Pampero</i> to "liberate" the island. His second-in-command, W. S. Crittenden, was a twenty-eight-year-old West Point graduate and Mexican War veteran.Spanish authorities learned their every move, dooming the mission before it began. L�pez landed his men at Bahia Honda, west of Havana, and marched inland as Crittenden remained on the coast with a small force. The American and his fifty would-beinsurgents, after fleeing in open boats, were captured at sea and following the failure of an appeal to the U.S. consul in Havana, all were executed by firing squad. L�pez subsequently surrendered and was condemned to death by garrote in Havana. Forty-nine of his followers were shot and 106 chained and shipped to Spain and Africa for imprisonment. The others presumably escaped.The failure of the expedition caused a riot in New Orleans and the sacking of the Spanish consulate.In his message to Congress that year, President Millard Fillmore expressed great disapproval of the entire adventure, especially its aftermath. But, beginning in 1850, above the offices of the <i>New York Sun,</i> the Cuban flag, five bars and a single star, snapped in the wind, a signal that the issue of Cuba under the "Spanish yoke" would not be forgotten.&nbsp;<br>The Civil War diverted attention from governmental talk about buying or annexing the island but the insurgency there continued unabated, aided by numerous filibustering and gunrunning expeditions, many of them launched from New Orleans, Key West and eastern seaboard ports of the United States.Cuban patriots proclaimed a revolution in October 1868, demanding freedom from Spanish rule and establishing a revolutionary "republic" in the hotbed eastern provinces of the island. It is estimated that two hundred thousand Spaniards and Cubans died in the Ten Years' War which followed the <i>grito</i> (cry) for independence, but the Spanish military held on to Havana and thus controlled most of the wealth of the island. Even so, the revolt was sustained by brilliant rebel leaders--M�ximo G�mez, Calixto Garcia, and Antonio Maceo among them--whose names would become even more familiar to Americans in the decades to come.While the United States did not intervene in the Ten Years' War, one episode in it outraged the nation and solidified sympathy for the <i>insurrectos</i> and their cause.The incident involved the <i>Virginius,</i> a sail-and-steam side-wheel vessel, and its captain, former Confederate officer Joseph Fry, a forty-seven-year-old native Floridian.On October 31, 1878, Fry's <i>Virginius</i> steamed out of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, toward the Cuban coast carrying a damning cargo: five hundred Remington rifles and four hundred handguns, plus sabers, explosives and medical supplies, clearly intended for the revolutionary armies around Santiago, Manzanillo and Bayamo. Moreover, he had on board four insurgent officers and a hundred rebel soldiers.In the Cayman Trench between Jamaica and the south Cuban coast, a Spanish gunboat spotted the <i>Virginius,</i> an American flag flapping from its topmast, and gave chase. Fry's crew, most of them Americans, tried to jettison the cargo but the ship was outrun, forced to surrender and follow the gunboat into Santiago Harbor.Fry denied running guns, lamely claiming that he was heading for Costa Rica and that his capture in international waters was an unlawful act. The Spanish authorities were unmoved and on November 4, after a quick trial, the four rebel generals, one of them a Canadian, were shot, then beheaded, their heads placed on pikes for public display. Three days later, Fry and his men were tried and sentenced to death. He and fifty-two crewmen of the <i>Virginius</i> were executed by firing squad.(Twenty years later an American army would fight a battle within walking distance of the place of execution.)President Grant gave some thought to an "intervention" in Cuba over the <i>Virginius</i> imbroglio but settled for the strongly worded messages and veiled threats dispatched to Madrid by his secretary of state, Hamilton Fish.There were no major battles in the Ten Years' War, only hit-and-run jungle skirmishes, cane-field burnings and similar guerrilla depredations. The war slogged on this way until 1878 when a treaty was signed in which Spain promised certain reforms. Slaverywas abolished on the island in 1886, but the other promises were forgotten.Veteran newspaperman Murat Halstead, once editor of the <i>Cincinnati Commercial Appeal,</i> who had served as correspondent in the American Civil War and the Franco-Prussian War, went to Cuba in the mid-1890s and found Spanish rule of the island fatally repressive. "Spain is stumbling down a dark and bloody road to her doom," he wrote. "Persistent, long continued injustice, and indifference or bitter hostility to all entreaties and demands for redress, have caused the Cubans to become conspirators, revolutionists, enemies and destroyers, all for self-government."Halstead was saddened by what he witnessed in the provinces--squalor, starvation, a grinding hopelessness--and observed, "It would have paid Spain well to have been occasionally gracious, for the Cubans have suffered long every form of humiliation before they were incensed to fury, and goaded into a consummate purpose for redemption and vengeance."Five hundred years of rule, Halstead said, had taught the rulers nothing. "The Spaniard's fault is that he has not been able to escape from his own system. He is its slave as Cuba is its victim. Oh, the pity of it, the disaster of it!"Others saw the pity of it, too. By 1895, the "plight of Cuba" had an international renown. It may have seemed to be an issue exclusively American--American newspaper coverage of the island's revolutions gave that impression--but it was not.3<i>"Here I might leave my bones ..."</i>"What this country needs is a war," Theodore Roosevelt told Senator Lodge in 1895 and another who felt that way about <i>his</i> country was a young subaltern in the Fourth Hussars, a fashionable cavalry regiment of Her Majesty Queen Victoria's army.He was a puny, freckled, delicate boy with wide-awake blue eyes, reddish hair and a matching ruddy complexion. He spoke with a faint lisp but animately and with a coiled-spring intensity. A descendent of the duke of Marlborough and the son of a peer of the realm, he affected some of the regimental airs of the day such as standing with his hands positioned on his hips under his gold-frogged uniform coat, elbows akimbo in a defiant posture, and he was known for asking too many questions of his superiors.He had graduated from the Sandhurst Royal Military Training College and now, in November 1895, at age twenty, was suffering from his country's unusual peaceableness. There was no fighting to speak of anywhere, not even in the Sudan as yet, or the northwest frontier of India. He was restless, eager, had five months' winter leave on his hands and nothing to do."From early youth I had brooded about soldiers and war," he later wrote, "and often I had imagined in dreams and day-dreams the sensations attendant upon being for the first time under fire. It seemed to my youthful mind that it must be a thrilling and immense experience to hear the whistle of bullets all around and to play at hazard from moment to moment with death and wounds."He searched the newspapers and consulted the maps. There had to be a war of some kind going on somewhere.He found one, a tiny insurrection on the Caribbean island of Cuba, the ideal kind of thing in which a colonial soldier could experience his baptism of fire.Rebel leaders with such names as Jose Marti, Maximo G�mez and Antonio Maceo were leading a revolt against Spanish rule; the commander of Spanish forces there, General Martinez de Campos, had occupied the principal towns and confined the guerrillas to the outlands and jungles far to the east of Havana.That was enough to know for the present and the young officer wrote a letter to General de Campos, then requested permission from his superiors to spend his winter leave with the Spanish army in Cuba. The commander-in-chief of the British army, LordWolseley, a veteran of wars from Burma to the Crimea, granted the request. He too, after all, had been an ambitious subaltern forty years ago.The hussar next visited the London offices of the <i>Daily Graphic</i> and left with a commission to write reports, at five guineas each, on the rebel rising in Cuba. Then, on November 2, 1895, he sailed from Liverpool with a regimental friend and arrived in New York on the tenth. He put up in an apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, took in the sights, and after a few days boarded a train to Key West, Florida, where he embarked for Havana on the steamer <i>Olivette.</i>"When first in the dim light of early morning I saw the shores of Cuba rise and define themselves from dark-blue horizons, I felt as if I had sailed with Captain Silver and first gazed on Treasure Island," he would later write. "Here was a place where real things were going on. Here was a scene of vital action. Here was a place where anything might happen. Here was a place where something would certainly happen. Here I might leave my bones."On November 20, he stepped off the gangplank in the teeming Cuban capital and spent a day at the Gran Hotel Inglaterra before "setting out for the front," carrying copies of the letter he had written to General de Campos and his leave papers signed by Lord Wolseley.The Spanish general met him at Santa Clara, 150 miles east of Havana, and sent him forty miles southeast to Sancti Spiritus, a town "beset by rebels" and decimated by yellow fever and smallpox. In the jungly village he met de Campos's officer-in-charge of the region, General Su�rez Valdez, who supplied the Englishman with horses and servants and invited him to accompany the Spanish troops in the field.General Valdez, with four battalions of infantry, two squadrons of cavalry and a mule-drawn gun battery, marched out of Sancti Spiritus in pursuit of a rebel band led by Antonio Maceo, a handsome,scholarly subordinate of M�ximo G�mez, the iron-willed Dominican professional soldier whose history of guerrilla fighting dated back to the Ten Years' War of the 1870s.On November 30, his twenty-first birthday, the hussar got his fondest wish: He heard the pop of rifle fire and the buzz of bullets about his head when Maceo's rebel snipers opened fire as he ate a skimpy breakfast with some Spanish officers. For four days thereafter he followed Su�rez Valdez's force through the thick jungle until, on December 3, at a machete-cleared place in the thick brush called La Reforma, the general led an attack against the Maceo rearguard, two thousand Spaniards killing thirty or forty rebels and taking an insignificant hill....</p><h2>Psychonauts Official Strategy Guide</h2><p><p>BradyGames' <i>Psychonauts Official Strategy Guide</i> includes the following:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li> <b>WALKTHROUGH WITH AREA MAPS -</b> important locations and items are indicated! </li> <li> <b>REAL WORLD ITEM LOCATOR - </b>for those who don&#x2019;t need a walkthrough, but want help finding every item! </li> <li> <b>BASIC BRAINING </b>&#x2014; learn everything from basic controls to earning badges! </li> <li> <b>AND MORE &#x2014; </b>character information and cheats! </li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Platform:&nbsp;PlayStation 2, Xbox, &amp; PC</p> <p>Genre:&nbsp;Action/Adventure</p> <p>This&nbsp;product&nbsp;is&nbsp;available&nbsp;for&nbsp;sale&nbsp;in&nbsp;North&nbsp;America&nbsp;only.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Last Surgeon: A Novel</h2><p><p>Surgeon Nick Garrity, a vet suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, spends his days and nights dispensing medical treatment from a mobile clinic to the homeless in D.C. and Baltimore.

He is one of the key figures in poststructuralism, and one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century. Cinema I is a revolutionary work in the theory of cinema and begins Deleuze&#39;s major reassessment of film, concluded in Cinema II. In it, Deleuze identifies three distinct principal types of &#39;image movement&#39; and draws upon diverse examples from the work of such major filmmakers as Griffith, Eisenstein, Cassavetes and Altman. Translated by Hugh Tomlinson and Babara Habberjam.</p><p>Gilles Deleuze was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Paris VIII."<i>Cinema I </i>and <i>Cinema II </i>must be understood as works of philosophy, not of film criticism. They are Deleuze's reflection on the new ways the cinema enables us to think about time and movement, opening up insights into semiotics and our ideological construction of a world increasingly experienced through representational media.... The main purpose of these books is to identify and explore the implications of a vital shift from classical, pre-World War II cinema of the movement-image to post-World War II cinema of the time-imaging.... "<i>Cinema 1 </i>and <i>Cinema 2 </i>perhaps ultimately have more to teach us about philosophy, conceptions of subjectivity, and hermeneutics than to say something about any specific film. These books are challenging because they develop their own vocabulary in dialogue with the history of philosophy, and they assume a wide knowledge of films from the Soviet, European and Hollywood traditions. They reward the effort required to read them, however, for the original tools with which they provide us to understand cinema and semiotics more generally. Deleuze concludes that it is important to think of cinema not as a language, but as a way of bringing to light 'intelligible content' which is a condition through which language constructs its objects (<i>Cinema 2, </i>p.251). Thus, purely optical and sound images which do not extend into action might be one way in which aesthetics might help us break outside of the determining structure of linguistic systems, enabling us to imagine the world otherwise. Deleuze helps us to see cinema as more than just a collection of texts but as additionally 'a new practice of images and signs, whose theory philosophy must produce as conceptual practice' (<i>Cinema 2, </i>p. 269)."- Sherryl Vint, <i>Film International, </i>Issue 27v (<i>Film International</i>)<br><br> &#x201c;<i>Cinema I </i>and <i>Cinema II </i>must be understood as works of philosophy, not of film criticism.

Michael Patrick MacDonald grew up in Southie's Old Colony housing project. He describes the way this world within a world felt to the troubled yet keenly gifted observer he was even as a child: "[as if] we were protected, as if the whole neighborhood was watching our backs for threats, watching for all the enemies we could never really define."<br><br>But the threats-poverty, drugs, a shadowy gangster world-were real. MacDonald lost four of his siblings to violence and poverty. <i>All Souls</i> is heart-breaking testimony to lives lost too early, and the story of how a place so filled with pain could still be "the best place in the world."<br><br>We meet Ma, Michael's mini-skirted, accordian-playing, usually single mother who cares for her children&#x2014;there are eventually eleven&#x2014;through a combination of high spirits and inspired "getting over." And there are Michael's older siblings&#x2014;Davey, sweet artist-dreamer; Kevin, child genius of scam; and Frankie, Golden Gloves boxer and neighborhood hero&#x2014;whose lives are high-wire acts played out in a world of poverty and pride.<br><br>But too soon Southie becomes a place controlled by resident gangster Whitey Bulger, later revealed to be an FBI informant even as he ran the drug culture that Southie supposedly never had. It was a world primed for the escalation of class violence-and then, with deadly and sickening inevitability, of racial violence that swirled around forced busing. MacDonald, eight years old when the riots hit, gives an explosive account of the asphalt warfare. He tells of feeling "part of it all, part of something bigger than I'd ever imagined, part of something that was on the national news every night."<br><br>Within a few years-a sequence laid out in <i>All Souls</i> with mesmerizing urgency-the neighborhood's collapse is echoed by the MacDonald family's tragedies. All but destroyed by grief and by the Southie code that <br>doesn't allow him to feel it, MacDonald gets out. His work as a peace activist, first in the all-Black neighborhoods of nearby Roxbury, then back to the Southie he can't help but love, is the powerfully redemptive close to a story that will leave readers utterly shaken and changed.</p><p>Michael Patrick MacDonald grew up in &#34;the best place in the world&#34;--the Old Colony projects of South Boston--where 85% of the residents collect welfare in an area with the highest concentration of impoverished whites in the U.S. In All Souls, MacDonald takes us deep into the secret heart of Southie. With radiant insight, he opens up a contradictory world, where residents are besieged by gangs and crime but refuse to admit any problems, remaining fiercely loyal to their community. MacDonald also introduces us to the unforgettable people who inhabit this proud neighborhood. We meet his mother, Ma MacDonald, an accordion-playing, spiked-heel-wearing, indomitable mother to all; Whitey Bulger, the lord of Southie, gangster and father figure, protector and punisher; and Michael&#39;s beloved siblings, nearly half of whom were lost forever to drugs, murder, or suicide. By turns explosive and touching, All Souls ultimately shares a powerful message of hope, renewal, and redemption."If you were charmed by Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes . . . try All Souls, Michael Patrick MacDonald's guileless and powerful memoir."<br>--Time<br><br>"ALL SOULS IS THE WRITTEN EQUIVALENT OF AN IRISH WAKE, WHERE REVELERS DANCE AND SING THE DEAD PERSON'S PRAISES.
